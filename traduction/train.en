2 . 
oh , oh ! 
oh , oh ! 
oh , oh ! 
let us remember , Mr. Speaker , that these segments of our society form the backbone of our economy . 
hear , hear ! 
hear , hear ! 
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Minister of Transport . 
both have many years experience in the manufacture and distribution of forest products . 
1 . 
another point I should like to discuss is the right of the supplier to choose his customers as he sees fit . 
i am getting sick and tired of ministers who seem to have some hang - up with regard to the collective bargaining process . 
there is just one specific item more that I would like to comment upon and then I will sit down , Mr. Speaker . 
order , please . 
3 . 
i can refer him to no better authority on the subject than the hon. member for Don Valley , not just myself . 
it is quite understandable . 
in addition , it could become a serious threat to Confederation and national unity . 
in view of this , we deemed it inadvisable to attend the meeting and so informed COJO . 
Mr. Speaker , the minister suggested that a greater building program might lead to inflationary pressure . 
i disagree with the argument advanced by the minister . 
there is a lot to be said on both sides of that question . 
order . 
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated to the Leader of the Opposition , I would hope to make an announcement on this question on November 1 . 
quite right . 
it does not bring anybody closer to rehabilitation to isolate him from the public . 
he left a wife and family . 
on a point of order , Mr. Chairman , I am sure the hon. member for Verdun would not have denigrated my position . 
can the insurance industry in turn act as an airline ? 
i say this to you , Mr. Speaker : the people of Toronto know the government has no answers . 
their evidence on the state of each stock was taken fully into account . 
thank you very much , Mr. Speaker , and I thank hon. members for allowing me the privilege to continue . 
i urge this intensive study , Mr. Speaker , for we know so little about the reasons that turn people into criminals . 
the government must assist its own employees who may need another language to advance their careers . 
i do not have any qualms about the type of language I use . 
motion agreed to . 
Mr. Speaker , no decision has been reached as yet but I should think so . 
the matter of trade relations with our European counterparts should be very seriously considered . 
what we should be concerned with in this country is the situation when these animals are shipped out of Canada for this purpose . 
they have already given an indication of the branches they intend to close . 
this minister watched while half the proceeds and profits of the Canadian agriculture industry were swept away in a budget speech . 
Mr. Chairman , absolutely none . 
we are analysing the report now and I hope to have some information for the House in the near future . 
hear , hear ! 
hear , hear ! 
i would therefore move , seconded by the hon. member for Dartmouth - Halifax East ( Mr. Forrestall ) : 
when we realize the extent of the ravages caused by organized crime in our country , we must consider deep - rooted solutions . 
but oh how their popularity soared and they coasted through on that . 
( 2 ) A committee is bound by , and not at liberty to depart from , the order of reference . 
there is one other point I should like to make , and I do so as I feel this is a general debate . 
in December there was an announcement that British Columbia would be withdrawing from CEMA . 
they have also given rise to considerable opposition by hon. members in all parties on this side of the House . 
those are not the lines that one should be concerned about at this time . 
i have allowed the hon. member two supplementaries and in fairness I think we should go to some other hon. members . 
i think that is good . 
i think that the time taken in handling routine applications for changes of facilities along a pipeline , for example , has been too long . 
he is the minister who is responsible for science and technology , and he does not know . 
federal government carpenters get $ 6.42 in Toronto and $ 5.23 in Halifax and Moncton . 
for the record I would like to refer to a press release which followed the federal - provincial conference of attorneys general in October , 1975 . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i think the railroad term is « demand loading » . 
i will come to the cost of boats these days . 
in most provinces , general noise regulations have been implemented , the main principle of which is as follows : 
agreed . 
after all , energy is used by people throughout the nation , and the government might well consider an approach using the incentive to which I have referred . 
6 . 
i will be glad , when we have time , to sit down with hon. members and work this matter out on a productive and prospective basis . 
will the minister take action to clear up any difficulties because of the absolute need for placing the orders now , and not some months from now ? 
it will spur the construction of new fishing boats and cause new processing facilities to be built . 
there are many things I could say about Bill C - 19 . 
i am going to say something a bit later on about that because I think it is essential to the kind of debate we are having this afternoon . 
companies find that the rules are complicated , cumbersome and changing all the time . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister in charge of the Canadian Wheat Board . 
i understand that a rate of at least 70 per cent per annum is being contemplated . 
it is our hope to make a decision this week . 
we accept your view . 
they fought an election on that position . 
12 . 
Mr. Speaker , I say to that : what a cruel hoax , because a hoax it is . 
Mr. Speaker , we will try to stick to that suggestion . 
1 . ( a ) $ 98,355 . ( b ) They are distributed through major post offices across the country . 
crime is a national problem according to our constitution , while law enforcement is a provincial and local responsibility . 
i submit that what I say is pertinent to the bill , to moneys being spent on medicare and the manner in which they are spent . 
a few words about this disease might help to put things into perspective . 
fortunately they are fewer this year , more reasonable and responsible , more conciliatory . 
this bill has been before the House for more than a year . 
retired December 30 , 1975 following completion of 34 years of public service . 
passage of the hon. member 's motion would mean that the content requirements are spelled out in the statute and we could debate them . 
this does not necessarily indicate non - compliance on the part of the parties . 
i was not asking for a detailed explanation as to what he was doing . 
how can so much be asked , on the one hand , and so little answered on the other ? 
as a result , perhaps he will bring in different legislation which will not lay him open to the charge of censorship . 
either they do their job properly , or you must get the power so that you can be sure that they do it properly . 
in our national capital we have all the strains and all the divergencies of our country . 
hon. John N . Turner ( Minister of Finance ) moved : 
as much as I hate to admit it , there has been good legislation brought in by Liberal governments in this country -- 
as the member for the neighbouring riding I am well aware of his persistence and hard work . 
where is the AIB ? 
at the moment , that fact , unfortunately , is seen in two - thirds of the country not as an opportunity , but as a barrier to opportunity . 
do not force a moratorium down our throats . 
this not the first time that members of parliament are going to hear that . 
the same recommendation was made in the report of the Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections on April 29 of last year . 
Mr. Speaker , I am afraid the hon. member is ill informed . 
in the MOT accident report it is stated : 
Mr. Speaker , the federal offer was for a $ 100 million program . 
in most samples of this size -- that is , a group of over 500 -- this would be called negligible . 
the traditional procedure for seeking new borrowing powers is to attach a clause to supply bills brought before the House . 
this strikes at the roots of democracy , and it is the right of the people to know . 
this would relieve the pressure on oil . 
the Special Investigation Division has not been in existence since early 1975 . 
moreover , this is not a matter of saying whether we are for or against some sort of assistance for adoptive parents . 
let us see the documents . 
canada has continued to give its support to the NATO alliance as an absolutely indispensable deterrent and an absolutely indispensable assurance of our security . 
can you believe such a ban in 1978 ? 
no , Mr. Chairman . 
naturally , the government attempts to get the best possible deal for the Canadian public in any series of negotiations . 
i would add , Mr. Speaker , that it must be continued . 
if I want any statistics as to where this country stands , certainly I will not refer to the speech made by the Prime Minister . 
we looked at all the implications of that . 
perhaps it would be a good idea for me to quote a Timmins newspaper because maybe it relates to the hon. member . 
Mr. Speaker , indeed I have the final report from the Prairie Rail Action Committee . 
( ii ) ( a ) Three vehicles will be used by six Canadian experts related to the provision of technical assistance . 
1979 . 
and we will implement every recommendation in the Auditor General 's report , something which we have been calling for over the last ten years . 
first , Mr. Speaker , I should like to make a few general remarks . 
Mr. Chairman , I will see if there is such a figure available , but I would quarrel with the words of the hon. member . 
i know he would not want to divert me from responding to a very serious question by his colleague . 
continually we get the message from across the way that this program will cost the government something . 
that is the crowd which did not like the 18 cents . 
what is at issue here is the principle that the public of Canada has a right to know about the constitution of Canada . 
they want to pick and choose what they will support . 
do you have it in writing ? 
i realize , Mr. Chairman , that there is no magic solution . 
in 1978 Americans divorced 1,122,000 times . 
the very result of unemployment breaks up families , and contributes to excessive alcohol and drug use . 
the official opposition was trying to destroy Petro - Canada in the short six months it was in office . 
instead of causing an internal schism , 
and now they are applauding themselves for voting against security of supply . 
as to making contributions , I am reminded of a story . 
madam Speaker , I would like to hear from the hon. member before I move my motion . 
the previous speaker also mentioned they would like to have the provinces involved in preparations for any meetings . 
my friend from Toronto says 53 more years . 
all of those estimates indicate that Canada will be in much more trouble as a result of the National Energy Program than we were in before . 
Mr. Prime Minister : 
indeed , there will be more divisiveness than positive effects . 
world - wide inflation is causing a severe form of economic dislocation . 
the PT7 represents the beginning of a new family of engines in a power range above that of the highly successful PT6 engine . 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the opportunity to join in this adjournment debate -- 
the competition policy is as vital to an industrial strategy as the over - all plan or the specific set of plans which should be developed . 
we are now talking about $ 45 billion to construct the pipeline . 
these flaws are all reflected in this bill . 
at this stage of the debate of the resolution , there are three specific amendments which my party proposes to introduce . 
the government cannot claim that there is any change in the balance of ways and means . 
a substantial provision of federal assistance for regional development comes under this program , RIDA , and subsidiary units . 
what did the government do ? 
he said that if we use unemployment as the solution to inflation , we will get recovery . 
conservation is beginning to have its effect . 
there could be a steel mill in British Columbia , for example . 
order , please . 
that is why professionals should not be charged for their work in progress . 
i believe , Mr. Speaker , that what is happening today is a good thing but it is just the beginning . 
however , the people of Canada are responsible for making those payments . 
we are now faced with legislation that is designed to withdraw from programs that were introduced at a time when we could afford them . 
that is why we had to import 25,000 skilled workers into this country at a time when unemployment was rising . 
as Carter said back in the 1960s , « A buck is a buck is a buck » and should be taxed as such . 
order , please . 
all of this means a total cut over the next two years of $ 2,958 , or 15 per cent of the original $ 20,000 salary . 
we heard in the news this morning that the Heath - Steele mine in northern New Brunswick is being closed down . 
they are ready to follow our leadership . 
we have a number of those kinds of programs and discussions going on at the present moment . 
out of that momentum of ideas and activity , we have to ask ourselves , why has the development problem not been solved ? 
i would like to end on a positive note , Mr. Speaker . 
i want to make it plain , Mr. Speaker , that the federal government does not set retail prices . 
the House met at 2 p.m. 
i remind hon. members that the minister in respect of transmission lines referred to the same power that now exist . 
that is truly a laudable goal with which we all agree . 
madam Speaker , I have a supplementary question for the Minister of Transport . 
let me come now to Petro - Canada . 
this will result in tremendous savings . 
unfortunately , no one seems to know what the effect will be . 
we have allowed a subgovernment across the country to remove power from the House of Commons . 
that is quite substantial . 
what exactly is going on over there ? 
madam Speaker , I will be very brief . 
that Government simply tells the people what is good for them . 
it is the seasonally adjusted figures which show the .5 per cent drop which are the important figures . 
the Chair is really embarrassed by what is taking place . 
Mr. Speaker , I am sorry , I have not seen the statement by a British firm . 
fewer volunteers are available because so many women have returned to the work force . 
they work with them . 
it depends on the extent to which they apply themselves . 
i do not know if there is a Member in this House who would oppose allocating more money for the elderly . 
they also have a role to play in the food chain . 
this has given a more democratic element to the things we were faced with in our constituency . 
the problem is to obscure the memories of everyone who heard the Minister 's stupid statements of a week ago . 
will the Ministry fill in the ravine at the end of runway 24L at the Pearson International Airport at Toronto ? 
if we ever introduce such legislation , I will remind him of his offer . 
my response is , so what ? 
this , Sir , is what I recommend to the House . 
whether that will do any good , I do not know . 
that is the principle which must guide the Alliance in the future as we seek fair and verifiable agreements with the Soviet Union . 
i guess the same kind of answer would have to apply to the matter of automobiles . 
they are bringing before the House a Bill that will restrict those liberties . 
for debate , the Hon. Member for Bow River ( Mr. Taylor ) . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
the Government refuses to believe it . 
those were very challenging commitments , a sort of preview of what the very important agricultural sector might become . 
there are two revolving - door syndrome and gating . 
i hope he will be back with that mobilized public opinion . 
i think the argument being made by the Government is faulty . 
however , we do have enough money to bail out two banks . 
order . 
it can be stolen just as other types of property can be stolen . 
and , second , Mr. Speaker , what we have been doing since last November is building up a climate of confidence . 
members should know that credit unions are a very big factor in financial institutions in western Canada . 
the Member for Cochrane - Superior ( Mr. Penner ) said earlier tonight that the onus is on the Government to free up its Members . 
that is my point . 
what of women who live far from centres where these services are available ? 
they ask the Members of this House to put an end to all cuts in personnel at these shops . 
it is not a question of joining ; we are well ahead . 
in an article written by Dr. Kenneth Hare , recognized in this country as being one of our foremost atmospheric scientists , the following appears : 
the impact is pervasive . 
in other words , a subsidy of about $ 2 per bushel will come from the Reagan administration to the grain farmers of the United States . 
the full report will be coming in before the fall . 
if these rules were put in place , would we indeed be treating everyone in the same way ? 
in them this former distinguished Speaker of the House talked about sexual harassment where some women had to disrobe to qualify for their jobs . 
i am simply alerting Members to a problem that I see , given what has been happening . 
the Conservatives while in Opposition , of course , said quite the contrary to what they are doing now . 
in point of fact , both the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General have responded fully , as best human beings can . 
does the Deputy Prime Minister believe that this is the way for a responsible Government , or an independent nation , to make an international treaty ? 
the parliamentary subcommittee is considering the whole question of equality rights . 
the fact is that no applications involving fewer than four student employees is being subjected to any test of whether or not the jobs are career oriented . 
we also want a series of objective criteria based on factors such as those I am referring to . 
if we proceed on that basis in this or in any other direction in public life , we will always be able to find excuses . 
then you brought in your program , the hotel went down the tube and Fort St. John became a ghost town . 
well , in six months , we did consult , we sat down with the Minister and hammered out an agreement . 
the Right Hon. Member might disagree with her perspective as well . 
" let us try it , " they say , " and see if it works . 
approximately $ 3 million of this amount is allocated from DREE funds , with the remainder being committed by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development . 
it cannot be stressed too often that Canadians are disturbed by the increase in violent crime . 
grain exports are projected to fall by 25 per cent in the 1984 - 85 crop year . 
we are so far behind in this field it makes the whole country feel embarassed . 
they do not really change the status . 
there is no longer any distinction to be made on a rational basis between an intermediate range and an intercontinental range nuclear missile . 
could I ask the Member for Western Arctic for a brief answer , if possible . 
greater Victoria is a tourist mecca . 
that tax will not be collected and then refunded . 
there has been a commitment in the past that their participation rate would go at least to historic levels if not traditional levels . 
that is to say , at the request of the person who may be going to declare his refugee claim . 
that is the actual situation . 
equalization payments have become quite considerable through the years . 
it has been a matter of concern to representatives of all parties . 
i would also like to advise the House that there was a degree of consultation with respect to the PC caucus members from Manitoba . 
the part played by military personnel and their families in the life of the town will be long remembered in a most favourable light . 
with great respect , I must interrupt . 
i explained it then . 
if the Prime Minister said that he was willing to resume negociations with Quebec , why are they in such a hurry to pass this Bill ? 
in fact , that is why a number of my colleagues have spoken out quite vigorously on the subject . 
i should like to put on the record just exactly what is in the notes on the financial statement of March 31 , 1984 . 
that judgment is sent to the individual in question . 
that does not make sense . 
Mr. Speaker , many authorities were involved in acting on this emergency . 
however , what happened to the studies that were conducted after that incident occurred ? 
there was a clear understanding by the former Minister of Transport that these regulations would not be promulgated for a year . 
i feel that is an attitude in Cabinet which we do not have the luxury of allowing to continue . 
in other words , Mr. Speaker , the Government must implement the recommendations of the Commissioner of Official Languages . 
they will then reduce the number of jobs because what they buy will be a duplication of other operations they have . 
it is at the second stage of review that the Supreme Court has ruled that a hearing is compulsory . 
as for lawyers specialized in immigration matters , the Bar takes upon itself to penalize them . 
the alternative in terms of foreign investment is loan capital . 
does he want to wait until the economy of those rural areas is completely down before responding to the acid rain problem ? 
i think that should not be too difficult to understand . 
however , we must not forget that the majority of beef and pork producers have rejected outright any mechanisms for marketing stabilization . 
if I had been in Bryce 's position , I would have been right in there with my nose to the public trough with the rest of them . 
in other words , we consider that the political role and the administrative role should be kept separate . 
as a result , the Government had to take steps to see that the company was taken over . 
all of these heritage places are managed by Parks Canada for the benefit and enjoyment of all Canadians . 
as I indicated earlier in this ruling , such discrimination was not envisaged in the Bill when it was given second reading . 
there is a role for both the public and the private sector . 
there will be more criticism , perhaps , because this Government , as I understand it , is committed to making things more open to the public . 
that is not good enough . 
he was the one who told us that the construction of a maintenance centre for VIA Rail in Montreal would be indefinitely postponed . 
but then Mr. Baldwin said : 
we want full public disclosure of company commitments involved in take - overs of Canadian business . 
there is also a need to co - ordinate with provincial Governments as to what certain areas require . 
they are of the opinion that by just changing the name from FIRA to Investment Canada we are going to have an automatic inflow of dollars . 
can the Minister tell this House what position the Canadian Government will take in this regard ? 
it is nine months since the election of this Government and we have yet to see a Budget . 
we currently allow the Canadian amateur athletic associations to be registered , and it is my belief that we should allow the provincial groups as well to be registered . 
a Canadian amateur athletic association by definition includes federal associations but does not include their provincial counterparts . 
to this battle Canada gave 1,800 gallant sailors and 24 proud ships . 
i find it incredible that the President of the Treasury Board would be laughing about a matter as serious as this . 
they have also asked for additional funding . 
well , everyone would agree with that . 
it is no wonder that there was no permanent chief executive officer for over 12 months . 
the Minister spoke of meetings and I applaud that . 
we had to put that in St. John 's . 
that is an accurate description of what is happening . 
they cannot be treated in isolation . 
he obviously does not like the co - op people in eastern Canada . 
the federal Government has a responsibility to be a policing agent . 
it wants to increase the percentage of its part - time workers to 45 per cent of its total work force . 
in the last Manitoba provincial election , 900 mail - in votes were received and were mostly from urban voters . 
what does basic common sense say ? 
standards are actually stricter in abattoirs built according to Quebec regulations . 
technicians make more than the writers and playwrights whose works are being performed . 
they were all leftists . 
it is well done . 
yes , we are a small nation and we are vulnerable because of our size . 
Mr. Wyman has many years of experience in the financial market sector . 
let 's think about that for just a moment . 
i do not think we should beat around the bush any longer about how to set things right . 
it says that resource impact funding helps Indian people to get a piece of the action . 
one of the major objectives of these consultations is to make sure that the recovery benefits all . 
Mr. Speaker , I think that in his speech , the Hon. Member from Baie - Comeau misrepresented reality . 
it is a matter of elementary justice that women 's jobs be fairly evaluated . 
we intend to continue this discussion with the benefit of the views of a wide range of interested parties . 
i think particularly of single parents . 
the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion treats all matters related to Quebec with a great deal of fairness and honesty . 
as a matter of fact that net farm income reached its lowest level since 1970 and the third lowest level since 1938 , some 45 years ago . 
in the Laval - Deux - Montagnes area , $ 225,000 was spent in 1984 but only $ 30,000 will be spent this year Mr. Speaker . 
this particular Minister made personal election promises that he would not only consult with fishermen but that he would be readily available when problems arise . 
that investment is being neglected , primarily in British Columbia . 
the outstanding issue has been the failure to make a funding commitment for the ERDA agreement . 
he should come clean on this issue this afternoon instead of giving us all this gobbledy - gook . 
he said that British Telecom « has not demonstrated its marketing savvy or product management ability » . 
foreign investment was running Canada as though it were the fifty - first State . 
it does not conduct research and development . 
the first question is : why does agriculture require stabilization ? 
as a general rule , all the producers of any given commodity are affected simultaneously by a cost - price squeeze . 
we have a diversified riding . 
so the real problem is that farmers are leaving farming . 
let us go to the question of what the public seems to be saying on this issue of Senate reform . 
as this is what is required , it is the target the Government has in mind . 
that , I believe , we all find unacceptable , regardless of political Party . 
let me return to the Bill which is before us . 
it is a mistake to do what the Tories are proposing to do to differentiate their Bill . 
we know how painful that can be for people who are going through a period of their life which is not particularly joyful . 
the establishment of such a system should therefore be a priority in each province where it does not already exist . 
we have been colleagues for a long time . 
it will help Canadian companies to accelerate their return to a healthy financial position by attracting new equity investment . 
the universal family allowance is maintained . 
research is a low priority . 
oh ? 
there are increased costs for shampoo and drinks for kids , pet food , gas , and even heating the home . 
this technique is not unusual on the basis of precedents . 
similarly , under the last Liberal Budget , personal income increased in 1984 by 7 per cent . 
but the Government treats itself to lavish spending and engages in bailing out corporations . 
there will be improved survivor benefit regulations for women , standards for pension benefit splitting on marriage breakdown , and equality standards . 
in fact , if one adds in some other things resulting from the Western Accord , I think it is more likely to be 2.8 cents per litre . 
we follow through with our election pledges . 
we must revive our economy , create jobs , rationalize government spending , administer with increased efficiency . 
it does not make a lot of sense , particularly when you look at who is paying . 
what will they do with that capital ? 
that is roughly equal to the $ 440 million paid to Canadair in two years . 
from these hearings , it became obvious that the major concern was capital gains . 
it indicates to individual Canadians that for too long Government has made their decisions for them . 
that brings to mind the hundreds of young Canadians I met recently , most of them quite disillusioned . 
this is why I cannot find myself supportive of the request for additional funding for the Government by way of borrowing . 
the Hon. Member says : « neglected Quebec » , and I agree . 
i was glad to hear that Crown corporations with a commercial value but no ongoing public policy purpose will be sold . 
we have taken these considerations very much into account when we designed the Budget . 
will the Prime Minister live up to that commitment ? 
can the Minister clarify the effect of the reduction ? 
thus far , I have been describing the physical aspects of my constituency . 
we believe they will accept the challenge . 
can he tell them that is fair ? 
it has been years and years since our business community got such a vote of confidence from Government . 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is providing the opposition . 
they stood to a person and applauded loudly . 
eight . 
no , Mr. Speaker , not quite . 
i would like now to go into the theory behind the removal of capital gains tax . 
it will increase poverty in the most vulnerable people , senior citizens , who will not be able to go out and find other sources of income . 
CFB Moose Jaw is also the home of the Snowbirds , Canada 's aerobatic air team . 
our caucus heard the other day from the Atlantic provinces economic council . 
come on , give us a break ! 
that is one major problem . 
i wish to direct the majority of my comments today to the many improvements offered in the pension programs available to all Canadians . 
furthermore , the erosion of the cost base of assets by inflation was also regarded as something that should be compensated for . 
the Budget is realistic because it takes a balanced and sensible approach . 
that is not the interest or concern of this Government . 
they voted for a change in the national affairs of our nation . 
on a point of order , Mr. Speaker . 
the facts are clear . 
the motion of the Hon. Member for Beaches therefore gives us an opportunity to do in this House what everyone else is now doing throughout the country . 
they also have a technical library , and the company spends nearly $ 2 million annually on these research services . 
second , we want to assist Canadian businesses to exploit opportunities for investment and technological advancement . 
not only are the risks greater but the time required to prepare for marine re - supply is lengthy . 
Mr. Speaker , once again the Liberal and NDP forecasters of economic doom and gloom have been proven wrong . 
i am not going to bother boring the House with those answers again . 
however , when we came into office we discovered that the trend line was going up . 
only the document cited need to be tabled by a Minister . 
furthermore , there is the provision in our resolution of having had to serve for a period in excess of 365 days in Canada as the basis of eligibility . 
the Government said that it had not had time to talk to either group about that proposal . 
in other words , the writing is on the wall . 
they were saying that homeowners would lose again because interest rates were rising . 
our international role has somehow collapsed . 
for instance , if we look at crop insurance , the federal Government has put up half the premiums and the producers have put up the other half . 
so we cannot think in those terms . 
the Minister has said that the only problem with Candu and the whole nuclear power option is a marketing one . 
why was it that I was receiving those kind of representations ? 
» that is what the present Prime Minister told the former Prime Minister . 
most of them are unable to work . 
a few days ago my colleague from Essex - Windsor gave the House a history lesson . 
the article reads : 
he said that he was burning oil . 
the Government has yet to come to the point of determining how and when this change should take place . 
i referred earlier to the bet taken up by the Prime Minister ( Mr. Mulroney ) concerning employment as related to immigration . 
however , we see in the legislation before us today only two substantive amendments and a number of housekeeping amendments to the Bill . 
we as a society cannot afford to discriminate among individuals on that sort of basis . 
this type of federal - provincial co - operation is required to increase the sensitivity and efficiency of our current disease surveillance systems . 
he suggested that June at least would be a better time . 
in 1934 , the company was renamed the Northern Transportation Company Limited , still under private ownership . 
i do commend the Minister of Transport for following through on the original terms of reference . 
then and only then does the private sector rush in saying that it cannot have all these publicly - owned corporations interfering in the private sector . 
specialty services such as stand - by supply vessels for the Beaufort Sea oil and gas industry can be provided by others . 
unfortunately or fortunately , however one views the issue , that particular Minister has not met with very much success . 
however , perhaps the Chair could dispose of Motion No. 1 . 
on the west coast we have the Minister 's Advisory Committee which , while not perfect , is at least of assistance . 
this is a fine example of a partnership in progress between government and industry . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Minister of Transport . 
Mr. Speaker , let me be clear . 
within the Government of Canada , a number of Departments have been actively involved and have been proceeding in a co - operative and coordinated fashion . 
however , the contradiction between what he said and what has been said by his officials requires further independent investigation . 
i know that we are trying to do it , at the federal level through the Farm Credit Corporation . 
these are key economic indicators . 
production is being expanded with the development of a sixth farm at Bowden Institution in Alberta . 
that was the principle of the Bill as passed on second reading . 
surely no one , and particularly no member of the Conservative Party , would believe that . 
the people of Canada did that on September 4 . 
call in the Members . 
we think that now is the time for the regulations and procedures to be properly established . 
the point was well taken because the success of these agreements will depend to a considerable degree upon the quality of their administration . 
canada can be proud of its record on human rights and should serve as an example of tolerance to other countries . 
whose advice did he follow in making his decision , in that his officials rejected it ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased that the Prime Minister has provided the information in the House . 
may I therefore ask the Hon. Member to refrain from any further displays . 
why did the Prime Minister appear prepared to disregard his promise in the first place ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am always amused by these probing questions from the Liberal Party , the Party which says that it would control the deficit . 
surely the Hon. Member is not suggesting that we levy taxes on companies that have been losing money . 
Mr. Speaker , the premise of the question put by the Hon. Member is wrong . 
how many people are employed ( a ) directly or by contract ( b ) full time and part time , in the Office of the Prime Minister ? 
the fees paid to each performer were in keeping with the role played in the gala and with the standards of the Union des Artistes . 
during the Liberal administration nothing was done about it . 
they know about the overproduction problem .

i want to thank you , my colleagues , for your vote of confidence today . 
it is very much appreciated and I take it to heart . 
there are some who say this House will be lively in the 36 th Parliament . 
i have never been in a Parliament that has not been lively . 
why should it not be ? 
you have come here because you have been chosen to be the spokespersons for Canadians across the land . 
you are going to hold strong opinions , and as well you should . 
and it is here , on the floor of the House of Commons , that we will have a chance to express our views . 
the last time I had the honour to be elected your Speaker I said that we are the political gladiators of Canada , and we are . 
our weapons are our words , our ideas , our beliefs . 
that is why things are lively . 
however , we can do our job in a spirit of respect for one another and for this institution . 
my task is to see to it that the rights and privileges of all of you parliamentarians of Canada are protected . 
generally speaking we have , you and I , three basic rights and privileges . 
we have the right to come to this place . 
we have the right to speak unafraid and we have the right to vote . 
i pledge to you that I will carry out my duties in a spirit of fairness and impartiality . 
i am , as you know , a servant of this House . 
it is the House collectively that makes decisions as to whether it wants to change and how it will change . 
parliamentarians of Canada , for the next few years because of circumstance , because of history and yes , because of destiny , the fate of our nation will rest in our hands . 
my dear colleagues , thank you again for the honour that you have bestowed on me today . 
and now , on to the work of this Parliament . 
i thank you very much . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
and the mace having been laid upon the table : 
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) :

speech FROM THE THRONE 
the Speaker : 
members of the House of Commons , 
ladies and Gentlemen : 
as Governor General I have visited every province and territory , and I wish every Canadian could share that experience . 
our cities , towns , and villages reflect the diversity of all those who have come to this country . 
and yet our communities , whether on the coasts or the prairies , whether in the woodlands or on the northern tundra , show the same friendliness , openness , and generosity . 
people care for each other in many ways , and they give their time and their support to their community . 
when I became Governor General , I stated my intention to honour the generosity of Canadians , especially as demonstrated by volunteers . 
we have now created the Caring Canadian Award to recognize the most dedicated among them . 
in my functions , I visit with many units of the Canadian Forces . 
they have impressed me with their dedication , as demonstrated by their peacekeeping role , their heroic work in search and rescue , and their immediate response to natural disasters such as the Saguenay region and Red River floods . 
let me mention another source of great pride : the proclamation of the twenty - first of June , the longest day of the year , as National Aboriginal Day - a day to honour the First Peoples of this land . 
a New Parliament - 
today marks the opening of a new Parliament , the last Parliament of the 20 th century and the first Parliament of the 21 st century , a Parliament with a unique and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national issues to secure the future for Canadians . 
on June 2 , 1997 , the people of Canada renewed the mandate of the Government . 
over the course of this Parliament , the Government will fulfil the commitments it made to the people in its election platform . 
the Parliament of Canada is the only institution directly elected by all Canadians with the mandate to protect and express the national interest . 
elected by all Canadians and endowed with the legitimacy that this bestows , the Government of Canada will stand up for the shared values of Canadians at home and abroad . 
but governing in the 21 st century also means recognizing that no one government can act alone . 
given the complexity of the issues that face us as citizens in a global economy , collaboration is an essential ingredient for the success of Canada . 
more than ever , Canadians want their governments to work together in partnership . 
as we look forward to the beginning of a new millennium with new challenges and new opportunities , we can look back at the last century of Canadian history and state with certainty that Canada is rightly regarded , the world over , as an extraordinary success . 
canada represents a triumph of the human spirit , bringing together the best of what people can do . 
- for a New Century of Canadian Achievement 
as old and familiar constraints of time and distance are breaking down , individuals and communities can accomplish things once unimaginable . 
canada is ready . 
we are poised for success . 
our citizens have the qualities that are needed to succeed in the 21 st century : 
we have the values of sharing and mutual help . 
we are well educated . 
we welcome innovation and new ideas . 
we are an open and democratic society . 
we are a bilingual and multicultural country at a time of increasing globalization . 
we have learned to accommodate our differences and diversity and turn them into strengths . 
our federation makes the most of these talents . 
it gives us the cohesion we need to multiply our strengths by combining our talents , by pooling our resources and by sharing risks . 
it also gives us the flexibility we need to experiment and innovate in order to succeed in a rapidly changing world . 
the Government wishes to recognize the important role of a professional , non - partisan public service in a well - performing civil society . 
canada is served well by its public service , and the effort and dedication it exhibits in meeting the needs of citizens and in building partnerships among governments and other sectors of society . 
the Government will continue to renew the Public Service of Canada to ensure its members have the skills and dedication to continue serving Canadians well . 
we Have Already Built a Foundation for Our Success 
in recent years , Canadians worked hard and sacrificed to overcome many of our nation ' s challenges . 
we succeeded , and have started to put in place a strong foundation for our success in the new millennium . 
this 36 th Parliament opens at a time when we have brought order to our public finances , and the economy is entering a period of strong growth . 
while unemployment is still too high , hundreds of thousands of new jobs are being created by the private sector , inflation is at very low levels , and interest rates are lower than they have been in more than three decades . 
more Canadian companies are selling more goods and services to the world than ever before . 
stimulating job creation and economic growth has been , remains , and will continue to be a major objective of the Government of Canada . 
the Government will build on the progress achieved and the foundations put in place over the last four years to strengthen the economy and increase confidence . 
we will pursue this course and take further action to encourage new investment , to create new jobs , and to generate the national wealth necessary to assure Canadians a stable and secure future . 
the Government will continue to be vigilant and responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in order : 
it will put the debt - to - GDP ratio on a permanent downward track . 
it will balance the budget no later than fiscal year 1998 - 99 . 
it will introduce legislation to implement the proposed changes to the Canada Pension Plan and the new Seniors Benefit in order to ensure Canada ' s public pension system remains sustainable in the 21 st century . 
one in three Canadian jobs depend on trade . 
our prosperity and our ability to create jobs are directly linked to how well we capitalize on international opportunities . 
team Canada trade missions have successfully generated new opportunities for Canadian businesses and have illustrated what we can accomplish when governments and the private sector collaborate . 
the Government will build on this success with a focussed strategy , developed in consultation with industry , to improve our international economic performance by expanding Canada ' s trade base , becoming the location of choice for global investment , and making Canada a preferred tourist destination . 
the Government has regained the ability to address priorities of Canadians while living within its means . 
it is now in the position to make strategic investments in our children and our youth , our health , our communities , and our knowledge and creativity while continuing to improve the nation ' s finances . 
the Government is committed to following this balanced approach of social investment and prudent financial management as it leads Canada toward renewed and lasting economic health and increased social cohesion . 
we are making the federation better able to serve the differing needs of Canadians across the country . 
Canadians feel better about their own future and the country ' s future . 
we are looking to our future together with a new optimism . 
the fact that we have demonstrated our ability as a country to set ambitious goals and achieve them gives us new confidence to set higher goals for the years ahead and succeed . 
our Challenge for the Future 
our challenge is to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward . 
the future belongs to societies whose economy is sound ; who invest in knowledge , education and innovation ; whose population is healthy ; whose children are well prepared to learn ; and who focus on securing a high quality of life for all citizens . 
Canadians have already set these priorities for this new Parliament . 
these are the Government ' s priorities . 
building a Stronger Canada 
the federal , provincial and territorial governments owe it to all Canadians to take responsible leadership on the unity of the country . 
the single most important commitment of the Government is to keep Canada united . 
the Government of Canada can have no greater duty or responsibility . 
the overriding goal of the Government of Canada as we approach the 21 st century is both simple and ambitious . 
it is to strengthen and unite this country by joining in the common purpose of keeping Canada one of the best places in the world in which to live . 
realizing these aspirations fully will require the active engagement of Canadians in all walks of life , as well as our institutions , businesses , voluntary organizations and our governments . 
it will require collaboration and partnership . 
it will require reaching out . 
in their meeting last week , nine Premiers and the two territorial leaders reiterated their desire for closer co - operation with the federal government in the areas of health care and social policy . 
the Government welcomes the Premiers ' and territorial leaders ' continuing interest in working together , and is committed to even closer collaboration on these important issues . 
as a next step , the First Ministers will meet this fall to work on co - operative approaches to address youth unemployment , health care and social policy renewal . 
the Government will take a very broad and encompassing approach to promoting and strengthening our unity . 
all its major initiatives will serve to make Canada better and thus more united . 
the Government will approach its mandate committed to collaboration and partnership with all its partners in Canadian society . 
canada provides our common space and our common means for realizing our potential . 
we would all be forever diminished , forever changed , should we fail to maintain the example Canada provides to the world . 
our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding . 
therefore , the Government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate that puts into question the future existence or unity of Canada . 
it will create a better understanding of the true complexity and difficulty for all of us in severing ties that have developed in building a nation together . 
most of all , it will demonstrate how much more we can do together than apart . 
the Government will work closely with provincial and territorial governments to further advance the progress made by nine Premiers and the territorial leaders last week in Calgary toward the full recognition of the diversity inherent in the federation , including the unique character of Quebec society . 
we will build on the mutual respect Canadians have for one another to achieve our common aspirations for a better future . 
investing in Children 
a country that has decided to invest in its children is a country that is confident in its future . 
a country that invests in its children successfully will have a better future . 
one of our objectives as a country should be to ensure that all Canadian children have the best possible opportunity to develop their full potential . 
we must equip our children with the capacities they need to be ready to learn and to participate fully in our society . 
while families have the greatest responsibility in the nurturing and development of our children , they are not alone . 
it requires focussing on what children need to thrive . 
the experiences of Canada ' s children , especially in the early years , influence their health , their well - being , and their ability to learn and adapt throughout their entire lives . 
by investing now in the well - being of today ' s children , we improve the long - term health of our society . 
addressing the needs of low - income families with children is therefore a priority of the Government . 
federal , provincial and territorial governments have agreed to address in a co - operative way the problems of low - income families with children . 
together we are now building the comprehensive and effective National Child Benefit System . 
the Government has already demonstrated its initial commitment to this project by increasing its contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by $ 850 million a year , with higher payments to families beginning July 1 , 1998 . 
the Government will work with its provincial and territorial partners to establish jointly a common timetable for increasing the federal contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by at least an additional $ 850 million during the course of this mandate . 
the Government will also work with the provinces and territories to establish the National Re - Investment Framework to guide the re - allocation of our partners ' savings into new services and benefits for low - income families with children . 
we can make a difference in the lives of all our children . 
children need a substantial investment of time and attention for healthy development ; they need strong families ; they need safe , supportive communities . 
the federal , provincial and territorial governments agreed in January 1997 to work together to develop the National Children ' s Agenda , a comprehensive strategy to improve the well - being of Canada ' s children . 
federal , provincial and territorial governments will work together to develop this broader agenda for children , including clear outcome measures by which to gauge success . 
as part of this national agenda , the federal government will undertake three new initiatives : 
it will establish Centres of Excellence to deepen our understanding of children ' s development and well - being and to improve our ability to respond to their needs . 
it will expand our Aboriginal Head Start program onto reserves to ensure that all Aboriginal children have the opportunity to get a good start in life . 
it will measure and report regularly on the readiness of Canadian children to learn , so that we can assess our progress in providing our children with the best possible start . 
investing in Quality Care and Good Health 
nonetheless , there is an increasing anxiety among Canadians about the present state and the future of our medicare system . 
citizens worry about whether they will have access to the highest possible quality of health care when they need it . 
the anxiety arises from a number of sources , including the pace and extent of restructuring that has gone on in recent years . 
the federal government recognizes that this restructuring has been difficult for Canadians and , therefore , it will increase health care funding to the provinces from previously budgeted levels . 
it will introduce legislation to increase to $ 12.5 billion a year the guaranteed annual cash payments to provinces and territories under the Canada Health and Social Transfer . 
one of our goals as a country must be to continue providing all our citizens with access to the highest possible quality of health care and the other tools they will need to enjoy healthy lives as we move into the 21 st century . 
Canadians have a right to expect their governments to work together in harmony to better meet the shared goals and desires of Canadians for a better health system . 
the Government is firmly committed to a publicly administered , comprehensive health care system that provides universal access to high quality care for Canadians anywhere in the country . 
the Government has a leadership role in preserving and enhancing medicare . 
it has a constructive role to play as a partner with provinces and other interested parties . 
the Government will play that role in a spirit of openness , pragmatism and innovation . 
there are steps that we can and will take to lead the efforts by all governments . 
preparing Canada for the 21 st century means ensuring the medicare system meets the needs of the future . 
it means responding to emerging issues in health care . 
working with its partners , the Government will undertake the following initiatives : 
it will take measures to support Canadians in responding to the expanding needs for home care and community care . 
it will develop a national plan , timetable and a fiscal framework for providing Canadians with better access to medically necessary drugs . 
it will improve the quality and effectiveness of health services across Canada by establishing the Health Transition Fund to help the provincial governments innovate in the areas of primary care and provide more integration in the delivery of health services , home care and pharmacare . 
Canadians recognize that good health depends on much more than medical care . 
our social and economic situations also help to determine the quality of our health . 
as a country , we must increase our efforts to promote healthy lives . 
the Government will contribute to this goal with an agenda to promote good health . 
emphasis will also be placed on those factors that determine the health of a country ' s population , including the equality of economic and social opportunity for all citizens . 
some of the most urgent health problems today are found in Aboriginal communities . 
the Government will work with other partners and Aboriginal communities to 
develop new initiatives to address the rapid increase in tuberculosis and diabetes in Aboriginal communities ; and 
enhance research and dissemination of health information focussed on the needs of Aboriginal people through a new Aboriginal Health Institute . 
the Government will work with its provincial partners and other interested parties to improve Canadian health information systems to improve decision making about health and health care across the country . 
building Safer Communities 
safe communities are among the hallmarks of our Canadian identity . 
while the reported crime rate has decreased for four consecutive years , it is still too high . 
the Government is committed to ensuring that Canada remains a place where Canadians feel secure in their homes and on the streets of their communities . 
a safe society depends on strong crime prevention efforts as well as traditional legal responses . 
governments around the world are developing community - based crime prevention programs . 
increase funding for community - based crime - prevention initiatives to $ 30 million per year ; 
develop alternatives to incarceration for low - risk , non - violent offenders , such as sentencing reforms , community diversion programs , and alternative sanctions ; and 
integrate information systems of all partners in the criminal justice system . 
creating Opportunity for Young Canadians 
today ' s generation of young Canadians is the best educated in our history . 
young Canadians are living in a country well - positioned for opportunities in the new economy . 
yet , the level of unemployment among Canadians between the ages of 18 and 25 is unacceptably high . 
the federal , provincial and territorial governments will act to address this problem , and First Ministers and territorial leaders will be working on this issue when they meet this fall . 
to secure our future as a society , our immediate challenge is to make sure that our young generation makes a successful transition to the world of work , that young people who want to continue to learn have access to education , and that young people who found it difficult getting started in the workplace get a second chance . 
all Canadians have a stake in meeting this challenge successfully . 
no single sector of society nor any one level of government has all the answers . 
we must all contribute , each in our areas of competency , to meet the challenge we have set for ourselves . 
the Government welcomes the action being taken by the private sector , through initiatives such as Career Edge and the Corporate Council on Youth in the Economy , and encourages the private sector to do more . 
the Government is committed to work with other governments , the private sector , communities and individual Canadians to help equip young people for the future . 
an important role for governments is to ensure the widest possible access to post - secondary education . 
Canadians are concerned about the increasing cost of higher education , and the resulting debt burden on students . 
the Government took some important measures to address this problem in its budget of February 1997 . 
the Government will continue to reduce barriers to post - secondary education through further changes to the Canada Student Loans Program , increased assistance for students with dependents , and new scholarships to encourage excellence and to help low - and moderate - income Canadians attend university or college . 
the Government finds it unacceptable that thousands of jobs are going unfilled in high - growth sectors of our economy at the same time as young Canadians are unemployed . 
the Government will work with the provinces , universities and colleges , the high - tech industry and other rapidly growing sectors to better forecast the number and types of jobs that will be available and to develop a plan for ensuring that people are appropriately educated to fill them . 
three factors make a significant difference to young people getting started in the world of work - a good education , a chance at a first job , and a mentor to work with as they establish themselves . 
the Government will increase its resources devoted to helping youth to make a smooth and productive entry into the world of work . 
internship programs have been particularly successful in helping young people get started . 
in partnership with provincial governments and the private sector , a Canada - wide mentorship program will be developed . 
to help those young Canadians who need a second chance , the Government will develop and expand community - based programs for youth with the greatest difficulty making the transition to the world of work because of low education and skills . 
these will include establishing multi - purpose Aboriginal youth centres that will provide targeted social and cultural support in addition to increasing work and learning opportunities for urban Aboriginal youth . 
the Government will continue to support efforts of individuals , communities and other governments to improve Canadians ' capacity to learn throughout their lives . 
investing in Knowledge and Creativity 
the revolution in the knowledge and information economy is transforming all sectors of the economy from primary resources to service industries . 
canada is well - positioned to be a world leader in the global knowledge - based economy of the 21 st century . 
we have the talent , we have the resources , we have the technology , and we have the institutions . 
by rising to the challenge of mobilizing our resources well , we can enable our citizens to succeed in the global knowledge - based economy . 
this is how we will spur continuing job creation and sustained growth in our standard of living in the 21 st century . 
the Government is determined to do more to support innovation and risk - taking in Canada and to attract more foreign investment in knowledge - based industries to Canada . 
we will build creative partnerships between the private and public sectors to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies in all sectors of the economy . 
in particular , the Government will significantly increase the resources allocated to help small and medium - size businesses develop and commercialize new technology . 
the Government will explore innovative policies and measures that give particular attention to increasing opportunity for Canadians in rural communities . 
it will adapt its programs to reflect the social and economic realities of rural Canada . 
further , the Government will redouble its efforts to ensure that rural communities and all regions of Canada share in the economic benefits of the global knowledge - based economy . 
governments have a crucial role to play in supporting science , technology , and the creation of knowledge . 
the Government of Canada ' s endowment of the Canada Foundation for Innovation in partnership with the private sector , the provinces and universities , is helping to build a leading - edge national system of innovation . 
all levels of government must do more to provide public support for research done in our universities . 
support for knowledge goes beyond support for university research . 
increasing support for the arts makes it possible for Canadian culture to reach audiences at home and abroad . 
our movies , books , magazines , plays , videos , music , and multi - media productions speak to us about our experiences at the same time as they present Canadian creativity to the world . 
therefore , the Government of Canada will provide increased support to the Canada Council and will make special efforts to support culture at home and to promote trade in Canadian cultural and educational products and services abroad . 
we will make the information and knowledge infrastructure accessible to all Canadians by the year 2000 , thereby making Canada the most connected nation in the world . 
this will provide individuals , schools , libraries , small and large businesses , rural and Aboriginal communities , public institutions , and all levels of government with new opportunities for learning , interacting , transacting business and developing their social and economic potential . 
for example , we will enhance the voluntary sector ' s capacity to engage Canadians by improving their access to the technology they need to play a stronger role in Canadian life . 
a connected nation is more than wires , cables and computers . 
it is a nation in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need to benefit from Canada ' s rapidly changing knowledge and information infrastructure . 
it is also a nation whose people are connected to each other . 
the Government will continue to work with provinces to ensure greater mobility for people with disabilities and to ensure their integration into the economic and social mainstream of Canadian life . 
the Government will also bring forward measures to strengthen networks among Canadians and to increase knowledge of Canada and understanding among Canadians ; these measures will include enhanced exchange programs for young Canadians . 
expanding Opportunities in Aboriginal Communities 
thousands of years ago , Aboriginal people began building Canada ' s first communities . 
today , by strengthening our Aboriginal communities , we are reinforcing the diversity that makes Canada unique in the world . 
the Government will 
develop relationships with Aboriginal people based on the principles of partnership , transparency , predictability and accountability ; 
support the building of strong Aboriginal communities - communities that provide their members with better living standards and opportunities ; and 
strengthen the capacity for good government in Aboriginal communities . 
to contribute , the Government of Canada is committed to respond to the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples as soon as possible . 
looking Outward 
this tradition is the legacy of Nobel laureate and former prime minister of Canada , Lester Pearson , whose 100 th birthday we mark this year . 
Canadians want their government to carry on this tradition and give it new relevance as the world enters a new century . 
nothing better illustrates the ongoing commitment to this tradition than Canada ' s leadership since 1994 in the international effort to ban anti - personnel mines . 
this Canadian initiative has evolved from a bold idea to be the focus of a large and growing international consensus that will culminate in the signing of an international treaty in Ottawa in December of this year . 
canada ' s rich and diverse natural heritage is also a source of national pride and international acclaim . 
Canadians are both the beneficiaries and the stewards of a land that holds 9 % of the Earth ' s fresh water , 10 % of its forests , and 25 % of its wetlands . 
Canadians both delight in our magnificent environment and fear for its future . 
maintaining what is good , and improving what has been degraded , requires constant effort . 
it is an effort that the Government will make . 
the Government is committed to working in the international community to promote sustainable development and to achieve practical solutions to global environmental problems , such as greenhouse gas emissions and toxic chemicals . 
it will also continue to address the serious international problem of over - fishing . 
it is committed to acting at home to reduce our contribution to these problems . 
in this same Canadian tradition of internationalism , the Government will undertake the following initiatives : 
it will promote Canadian values on the world stage by co - operating with like - minded countries to revitalize the United Nations and other key multilateral institutions . 
it will work directly with other countries to enhance and promote human rights , peace building and democracy . 
it will destroy the Department of National Defence ' s stock of land mines , in advance of the signing of the Ottawa Treaty in December , to continue its leadership and illustrate its commitment to a global ban . 
and Canada will continue to work toward an accompanying international strategy to help land mine victims recover and civilian populations reclaim their land from these mines . 
it will continue to move forward with reforms to the Canadian military . 
it will continue its campaign for liberalized trade . 
breaking down trade barriers , both within Canada and around the world , helps ensure markets for Canadian goods and services and provides the best opportunity for greater prosperity . 
celebrating the Millennium 
for Canadians , the start of the new millennium represents an historic opportunity to celebrate our achievements as a nation and our hopes for the future . 
it will be an unequalled opportunity to show ourselves and the world the richness of our diversity , the strength of Canadian values , and the great promise of our future in the 21 st century . 
the Government will help build a partnership among governments , communities and citizens to mark the new millennium . 
many Canadians have creative ideas and suggestions for millennium projects . 
there will also be an opportunity for parliamentarians from all parties to participate in developing ideas to mark the millennium . 
moving Forward into the 21 st Century 
almost 100 years ago , Sir Wilfrid Laurier said , " The 20 th century shall be the century of Canada and of Canadian development . " 
he was right . 
today , we have the opportunity for success in the 21 st century that is far beyond what Laurier could have ever imagined . 
to achieve this success we have more work to do - work that no one can do alone . 
each and every one of us must assume personal responsibility for our community and our country . 
our greatest responsibility is to build a new spirit of sharing and mutual respect for a new century . 
by working together , by respecting the value of our diversity , we will secure our future and build a stronger country . 
we will ensure that our future economic opportunities are sound , our children well prepared , our lives healthy , and our communities strong . 
each generation has the opportunity to choose the society it wants to leave for its children . 
the greatest legacy we can leave to our children in the new millennium is a vibrant living legacy that will make Canada a better place : a stronger country with a brighter future and greater opportunities for its young people . 
by working together , we will build that future .

speech FROM THE THRONE 
address IN REPLY 
the House proceeded to the consideration of the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General at the opening of the session . 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a very great privilege and an honour that has been bestowed upon me today to make this motion which is to be seconded by the hon. member for Beauce for the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
i would like to thank the Prime Minister and the government for the honour they have bestowed on the people of Parkdale - High Park with their motion . 
i am also honoured and privileged to be the first member of Parliament of Latvian and Baltic States heritage to take a seat in the House of Commons , which in Latvian is stated as follows : 
i would like to thank the people of Parkdale - High Park who have placed their trust and confidence in me to represent their interests in the House of Commons . 
as their member I vow to work with my colleagues and in partnership with the private and non - profit sectors to address the challenges which we face today and in the future . 
i would also like to especially acknowledge and thank my hon. predecessor Mr. Jesse Flis who represented the riding of Parkdale - High Park for over 14 years . 
i would like to thank him for the legacy he has left in the riding . 
Mr. Flis , we salute , thank and applaud you . 
the riding of Parkdale - High Park , a microcosm of Canada , is one of the most culturally and economically diverse ridings in this country . 
it is a very united riding , a riding that takes strength from its diversity and its sense of community , a riding which is exemplary of what can be accomplished through community based activities and initiatives , a riding that shows that diversity does not equate to disunity . 
i believe that fostering partnerships is a key to addressing the issues and challenges which we will face today and in the future . 
in that context I would like to address three issues : job creation , the development of safe and prosperous communities , and the importance of the arts in articulating Canada ' s identity . 
in its previous mandate this government committed to Canadians that it would ensure its strong economic fundamentals would be in place in order to promote economic recovery and job creation . 
the Prime Minister and his government have been successful at meeting and surpassing their targets of deficit reduction . 
the government predicts that we shall see the deficit eliminated well prior to the end of this mandate . 
i commend my colleagues on their achievements . 
our purpose must now be to take advantage of a vigorous economy and create jobs . 
in my opinion , the government has a duty to ease job creation by promoting the kind of economic environment we need and by nurturing partnerships with the private and non - profit sectors . 
the Minister of Finance has completed the first task . 
the Minister of Industry and his colleagues are now responding to the second task with their jobs strategy . 
one aspect of the jobs strategy is to target youth employment . 
as the mother of three children I commend the government for the initiative it has recently undertaken with the announcement of the youth internship program . 
this program is a partnership combining the efforts of the federal government , the YMCA , and Career Edge , the non - profit agency developed by 100 Canadian corporations to promote youth employment . 
one of Canada ' s chartered banks has recently undertaken a comprehensive national study of the attitudes of Canada ' s nexus generation who are young people between the ages of 18 and 35 . 
this study reveals that this group is much more entrepreneurial and positive than usually depicted . 
one - third of nexus respondents stated that their most desirable profession was entrepreneur , suggesting that young Canadians are determined to turn their innovative ideas into business realities . 
further to this , it is my belief that government does not create jobs , the private sector does . 
in Canada over the last three years 70 per cent to 80 per cent of new jobs were created by small and medium size businesses . 
small business needs access to capital , trade and technology . 
government can help small business by encouraging banks , including the Business Development Bank of Canada , to lend money to these entrepreneurs . 
as well , government can support small business by arranging trade missions such as the successful team Canada initiatives and the November trade mission to Washington for women business owners . 
women - owned businesses are a significant sector of our economy . 
as a founding member of the Women Entrepreneurs of Canada , I know first hand about the strength of women - owned businesses . 
at the recent Women Leaders ' Network for APEC Economies held in Ottawa , it was noted that 700,000 companies in Canada are owned by women and that they employ 1.7 million people , which is greater than the Canadian Business top 100 companies . 
they are also creating jobs at a rate four times the national average . 
private trade missions should be encouraged . 
organizations such as Les Femmes Chefs d ' Entreprises Mondiales are vehicles through which private citizens can act as goodwill ambassadors and introduce Canadian products and services to other countries . 
in August I held job creation focus groups with business people , community leaders and residents in Parkdale - High Park . 
i also met with leaders from the arts community and Women Entrepreneurs of Canada . 
several critical points emerged from these discussions . 
it was emphasized that it was important to support small business and to reduce the amount of official paperwork and red tape that is required for the functioning of a small business . 
further , I was told about the real importance of developing strong community structures such as co - operative business development and the need to continue spending dollars on infrastructure which brings new technologies such as fibre optic cable and ISDN connections to the community . 
although supporting technology is of primary importance , we must acknowledge there is a need for a healthy environment as well as excellent basic facilities such as skating rinks , parks and community centres . 
a strong and prosperous community is safe and a safe community will be strong and thriving . 
in Parkdale - High Park just last month the Parkdale Community Watch won the distinguished 1997 International Society of Crime Prevention Practitioners community based program of the year award . 
this award acknowledges the success and initiative that Parkdale residents have taken toward combating crime in their community . 
this government recognizes the importance of these initiatives as evidenced by the recent announcement by the Minister of Justice that $ 150 million will be allocated over the next five years to foster such community based programs . 
creating partnerships with communities is essential . 
the value of community impact statements must be acknowledged , particularly in the case of alleged victimless crimes such as drugs and prostitution where the impact on the community is significant . 
consideration must be given to the imposition of more minimum sentences , allowing communities access to the briefing of federal judges and passing legislation to require the proceeds of crime to be reinvested into those communities affected . 
my constituents strongly believe that health and justice must work together in partnership with communities not only to fight crime but to fight the causes of crime . 
young offenders are one of the greatest tragedies of crime . 
victims of crime are not alone in feeling their loss , society too experiences a loss - that of the potential of a young life . 
we must redouble our efforts to rehabilitate young offenders and provide whatever support it takes to discourage repeat offenders . 
we must , however , ensure that , in the case of violent young offenders , the needs and demands of the public form part of vigorous measures taken to protect society . 
as a lawyer I applaud the Minister of Justice on her commitment to work with her provincial colleagues to reform the justice system in such a way as to better acknowledge the voice of all victims of crime . 
i would now like to address one area about which I am particularly passionate , the arts in Canada . 
as the former volunteer chair of one of Canada ' s foremost arts organizations I believe we must invest in programs , opportunities and partnerships which support our culture . 
this is one of our greatest responsibilities . 
a country ' s real strength lies in its people . 
the arts and the culture of a people are the expressions of its heart and soul . 
it is the movies , television , music , painting , dance and theatre that enable Canadians to laugh , talk and cry together . 
through them we can express our identity and our similarities and differences . 
i believe in investment , in investing in the development of original Canadian artistic product . 
without our own product , without our own voices , without a generation that shares our vision to keep our culture alive and meaningful , Canada will have no legacy . 
without this we will never get that opportunity to see our hopes and dreams reflected . 
instead we will have to watch and live vicariously through others . 
members will hear me speak in Parliament about the arts industry because I believe it is just that , an industry . 
when we start looking at it that way some surprising things turn up . 
the cultural sector represents a significant part of the Canadian economy . 
the cultural sector contributes $ 25 billion to Canada ' s gross domestic product . 
this means 900,000 jobs or 6.9 per cent of total employment . 
last year Canadians spent over $ 2.9 billion on arts events and products . 
for every dollar that the federal government has invested in the arts industry ten dollars of economic activity has been generated , an excellent rate of return . 
these numbers do not even acknowledge the spin off effect the culture also brings to our economy . 
" the House of Martin Guerre " a critically acclaimed production by Canadian composer Leslie Arden , brings people not only to the Canadian Stage Company but also to the restaurants , bars and hotels nearby . 
in Canada , the arts play a leading role in enabling Canadians to define themselves in relation to one another and to the rest of the world . 
if we want a strong national identity , we must ensure that control over our cultural institutions , publishing houses , radio and television networks and film productions rests with us . 
the Liberal government believes that we should balance spending in this sector with a plan to invest in the future of Canadian culture . 
artists and arts organizations will play a major role in determining how Canadians see themselves in 20 years . 
the arts are on the cutting edge of the development of new communications and new technologies which will play a major role in not only the economic prosperity of Canada but in the world . 
we should remember that the arts industry ' s sustenance and growth and the commensurate benefit to government revenues and Canadian society can be assisted by the Government of Canada without increasing the federal debt . 
i applaud the federal government ' s commitment to cultural organizations such as the Canadian Publishing Development Corporation and the Canada Council for the Arts , which is celebrating its 40 th anniversary . 
the creation of the Canada television and cable production fund has supported the creation of excellent Canadian programming . 
we should acknowledge the unique and important voice that the CBC provides to Canadian culture and Canadian life . 
we must continue to ensure the long term health of Canada and at the same time we should make sure we put in place partnerships to ensure that Canada ' s arts organizations and artists have a chance to continue to promote and develop the ideas , hopes and aspirations of all Canadians . 
the time has come to show the world that Canada has writers , artists , directors and performers second to none , and that we can develop artistic endeavours here in Canada which will be produced all over the world . 
canada as an exporter of Canadian cultural products and not an importer ? 
i say welcome to the new millennium . 
as members we have all been entrusted with an important responsibility , that of giving political leadership to Canada as we move into challenging times . 
while we may not all agree on the policy steps required , we do all commit to serving the best interests of our country . 
it is this difference of opinion that divides us into five parties and which will lead to spirited debate in this Parliament . 
debates are at the heart of parliamentary democracy , where it is appropriate to support opposing views . 
our political history has shown that the true superiority of the parliamentary system can be fully appreciated through the diversity of views being represented . 
i am proud to confirm my support for the Prime Minister and the Government of Canada . 
i vow to facilitate a true partnership among all Canadians toward making Canada an even greater country . 
i hereby move , seconded by the hon. member for Beauce , that the following address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada : 
to His Excellency the Right Honourable Rom é o A . LeBlanc , a Member of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada , Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada , Chancellor and Commander of the Order of Military Merit , Governor General and Commander - in - Chief of Canada . 
may it please your Excellency : 
we , Her Majesty ' s most loyal and dutiful subjects , the House of Commons of Canada , in Parliament assembled , beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to both Houses of Parliament . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wish to pay tribute to His Excellency the Governor General , Mr. Rom é o LeBlanc , and to thank him for giving the throne speech before both Houses . 
i would also like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on being re - elected to the Chair . 
we feel , and you have demonstrated to us , that you have all the qualities required for the important job of directing the work of the House . 
i would also like to thank the Prime Minister , who honoured me by asking me to move the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
in addition , I would like to congratulate all my colleagues on being elected to office . 
representing one ' s constituents well is no small challenge and I know that each of us , with God ' s help , will carry out our duties conscientiously , with respect for the institutions we serve and , of course , for the citizens of our country , Canada . 
i represent the wonderful riding of Beauce . 
i would like to take this opportunity to thank all my constituents for the very great honour they have bestowed on me by electing me to represent them in the House of Commons . 
our economy is made up of businesses working in very diversified sectors . 
from agriculture and forestry to manufacturing and the service industries , each sector is well represented in our economy . 
and let us not forget our excellent maple syrup , a favourite with everyone . 
it is because of these enterprises that it has often been said that the Beauce region is the kingdom of SMBs . 
the Beauce region , along with the Chaudi è re - Appalaches region , has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Quebec , 6.1 per cent in August of this year . 
what sets our region apart from others is that when we have a problem , we look for a solution , not a culprit . 
instead of going over old ground when it was elected to office on October 25 , 1993 , the Liberal government helped put an end to the crisis . 
today , after four years of Liberal government , Canada ' s economic performance is one of the best among the G - 7 industrial nations , and the future looks even more promising . 
that is why Canadians can look forward with great hope to the future . 
from the time of its first election in October 1993 , the Liberal government has made job creation its top priority . 
in its Employment Strategy , the Liberal government has put public finances back on a sound footing , starting by addressing the problem of the huge deficits inherited from past governments . 
it has reduced the deficit from $ 42 billion to under $ 14 billion . 
this good management has made it possible to keep interest and inflation rates at their lowest . 
these rates , moreover , help businesses to invest and to create jobs , which encourages purchases of major consumer goods . 
once the budget is balanced , half of each billion dollar budgetary surplus will be used to cut taxes and reduce the debt . 
the other half will be invested in important social and economic programs , including job creation initiatives . 
our government believes in young people . 
it invests annually in programs that enable young Canadians to acquire the knowledge and experience they need to get their careers off to a good start . 
in addition , it recently announced the youth internship program in the federal public sector . 
the government ' s priorities are first and foremost employment , improved public finances and Canadian unity . 
for the past 130 years , Canada ' s achievements have earned this country the admiration of the whole world . 
in fact , according to the United Nations , Canada happens to provide the best quality of life of any country in the world . 
we have reached this level of excellence largely thanks to the values of equality and diversity which we hold dear . 
to preserve and improve our federation is to preserve and improve the way we live . 
the Liberal government has demonstrated the flexibility and vigour of Canadian federalism . 
this same government has put forward new strategies for getting rid of duplication among levels of government , while showing greater respect for the jurisdictions set forth in the Constitution . 
the manpower agreement , for instance , is an example of our government ' s desire for a modern federalism . 
with the provinces , we have also reached an agreement on environmental harmonization . 
we have withdrawn from programs of direct involvement in mining and forestry development and have suggested transferring management of social housing to the provinces . 
finally , we suggested introducing federal - provincial mechanisms to deal with securities , food inspection and revenue collection . 
the principle of a new federalism will continue to guide our actions during the government ' s present mandate .

as is our practice on Wednesday we will now sing O Canada , and we will be led by the hon. member for Etobicoke North .

statements BY MEMBERS 
monitor JET TRAINER AIRCRAFT 
Mr. Bob Wood ( Nipissing , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to invite all members of Parliament to join me this evening at the National Aviation Museum for the unveiling of the Monitor jet trainer aircraft . 
i am very proud of this success story which will see a surplus defence department hangar utilized to build the first Canadian made military jet in over two decades . 
the hard work of the Air Base Property Corporation using Industry Canada and National Defence adjustment funds has paid off . 
their partnership with Canadian Aerospace and Sikorsky will develop a new aerospace industry in North Bay . 
i ask all members of the House to join me this evening at the Rockcliffe airport from 6 to 8 to view the future of military aviation manufacturing in Canada . 
experts from the Canadian Aerospace Group and Sikorsky will be on hand to explain this unique project . 
i look forward to seeing all members there this evening .

CHINESE CANADIANS 
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured to speak in the House for the first time . 
more than 700,000 people of Chinese ancestry live in Canada today , but that was not always so . 
in 1902 a royal commission decided that Asians were " unfit for full citizenship - obnoxious to a free community and dangerous to the state '' . 
in 1923 Mackenzie King ' s Liberal government passed the exclusion act which suspended Chinese immigration . 
Canadian Chinese call July 1 , 1923 , the day the exclusion act came into effect , humiliation day . 
in 1947 the exclusion act was repealed and Canadians of Chinese ancestry won their right to be reunited with their families . 
i would not be standing here today if that act had not been repealed . 
1997 marks the 50 th anniversary of the repeal . 
justice will be served only if Canada has learned a lesson from this bleak moment in history . 
* * * 
WHITBY WARRIORS 
Ms. Judi Longfield ( Whitby - Ajax , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to recognize the outstanding achievement of the Whitby Warriors Junior A Lacrosse Club . 
this past August the Whitby Warriors won the Minto Cup as the best Junior A lacrosse team in Canada . 
in spite of losing the first two games to the Burnaby Lakers they persevered and came back to win their next four games to take the best seven championship round in six games . 
the Warriors were led by their top scorers Paul Sallie , Pat Jones and Gavin Prout and backed up by the most valuable player awarded winning performance of goal tender Mike Wye . 
the Whitby Warriors are coached by Jim Bishop whose involvement in the sport of lacrosse spans some 51 years . 
Whitby ' s win was Mr. Bishop ' s eighth Minto Cup , coming 28 years after coaching the legendary Oshawa Green Gaels to seven consecutive Minto Cup championships . 
the determination and sportsmanship of the Whitby Warriors are an inspiration to us all . 
i know all members will join with me in honouring the Whitby Warriors as the Junior A champions in Canada ' s national summer sport .

national DEFENCE 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne ( Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in 1989 , the Department of National Defence was ordered by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to enrol more women in the next ten years . 
at the time , only 9.9 per cent of the members of our armed forces were women . 
today , eight years later , their numbers have remained virtually the same , with women accounting for a mere 10.7 per cent of the Canadian Armed Forces . 
we note today that the Department of National Defence has not done a thing to recruit women . 
but now they would have us believe they are complying with the Human Rights Tribunal order by launching a recruiting campaign aimed exclusively at women and known as " Operation Minerva '' . 
DND knows very well it is impossible to integrate women fully by 1999 . All I have to say to that is : too little too late . 
* * * 
Mr. Stan Keyes ( Hamilton West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise , on this first full sitting day of the 36 th Parliament , to reiterate my call to the Ontario government for an independent public inquiry into the July Plastimet fire in Hamilton . 
conservative Premier Mike Harris and his environment and health ministers have backtracked , flip - flopped on their pledges for an inquiry , citing the pathetic excuse of the need for evidence of wrongdoing . 
is it right that the local MPP had to awaken the provincial environment minister at 3 a.m. before the premier would dispatch air monitoring equipment to the toxic fire site ? 
why did the province first refuse and then later accept federal government assistance ? 
there are questions of compliance with the Ontario fire code , inventory lists , security , and locating a recycling plant near a hospital , schools and a high density residential area . 
frustrated with the Harris government smokescreen , my constituents demand an independent public inquiry to clear the smoke and to produce recommendations which might prevent an environmental tragedy like the Plastimet fire from ever happening again . 
* * * 
war CRIMINALS 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today in the House on a very important matter to my constituents of Thornhill , and I believe all Canadians , and that is the prosecution of war criminals . 
the people of Thornhill , especially the Jewish community , believe that Canada must be vigilant in prosecuting war criminals . 
canada has a moral obligation to deport those who have been found guilty of committing crimes against humanity . 
we must not be seen as a haven for Nazi war criminals and others who have committed war crimes . 
my constituents are aware of the commitment by the Liberal government to move on denaturalization and on deportation of those convicted of war crimes . 
finally Canada is taking action . 
canada is doing more now to track Nazi war criminals than almost any country in the world . 
since 1995 many deportation cases have been initiated and I am confident we will continue to pursue war criminals to the fullest extent of the law . 
while this issue is of special importance to the Jewish - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Nanaimo - Cowichan . 
* * * 
mother TERESA 
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today so that the House and its members might pay tribute to the life and memory of Mother Teresa . 
it was with great sadness that Canadians learned of her recent death . 
this godly and gracious woman was a beacon of hope to the sick and the poor living in the streets of Calcutta and whose suffering she tried to ease and deeply felt . 
her message to humanity was simple : yes , there is someone who cares . 
it is a message that in our world will continue to resonate loudly and will no doubt serve as her lasting legacy . 
with the passing of Mother Teresa the world will indeed be a colder place because the beacon of goodness , though not extinguished , burns a little less brightly today . 
i am sure all Canadians join me in being thankful for her life . 
i ask for all members to observe a time of silence in their own thoughts and pay tribute to the remarkable legacy of caring and giving that was Mother Teresa . 
* * * 
immigration 
Mr. Gary Pillitteri ( Niagara Falls , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this year the International Whirlpool Bridge that links Canada and the U.S. celebrated its 100 th anniversary . 
this important celebration reinforced the co - operation existing between our two great countries . 
it is therefore difficult to believe that a new American immigration law will soon require that all Canadian travellers entering and exiting the United States complete a visa information card . 
the community I represent is very concerned that this will cause endless hours of traffic jams and may damage the tourist and trade links we have established over a period of many years of co - operation . 
it is then my sincere hope the proposed amendments exempting Canadians travelling to the U.S. each year are passed as soon as possible . 
in the meantime I ask our government to keep pressure on our friends south of the border to implement the amendments so that this controversial law will not cause havoc in border communities across Canada . 
* * * 
ALGERIA 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , five months after condemning in this House the civil war in Algeria , the Canadian government has yet to call upon the international community to find a peaceful solution . 
this silence has made it possible for the tragic events that took place in Benthala , Algeria , over Monday night , to occur . 
the majority of the 200 people killed in this massacre were women and children . 
in view of the increase in acts of terrorism and senseless violence in Algeria that have left more than 60,000 victims in recent years , according to Amnesty International estimates , Quebec , Canada and the international community must echo the voices of the bereaved families by utterly condemning the use of violence and seeking a political solution to the Algerian crisis . 
* * * 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as a black Canadian from Quebec , of aboriginal and French descent , I am very proud to represent the riding of Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine in the 36 th Parliament of Canada . 
the Speech from the Throne delivered yesterday is , in my opinion , a speech on national unity . 
i wish to advise the House , and in particular the Hon. St é phane Dion , Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs - 
the Speaker : 
my dear colleague , you must not refer to hon. members by name , but by riding . 
you have a few more seconds . 
Ms. Marlene Jennings : 
i wish to advise the House that my constituents are delighted with the initiatives of the government with respect to the Canadian unity file . 
i want to assure the House that I intend to continue to contribute and encourage my constituents to actively support these very welcome and timely initiatives . 
* * * 
CANADIAN ECONOMY 
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there can be no doubt that the Canadian economy is back on track . 
the cost of living is going up very slowly , while retail trade is stronger than it has been in years . 
statistics Canada announced that , between July and August , the consumer price index increased by 0.19 per cent , the same level as for the two previous months . 
between August 1996 and August 1997 , Canadian consumers have faced an average increase of 1.8 per cent in the cost of living , which is pretty low . 
all this is good news for Canadians . 
* * * 
pay EQUITY 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the federal government has decided to give public service executives bonuses totalling some $ 12.2 million , when close to $ 2 billion is owed to the 80,000 members of the Public Service Alliance of Canada , and when many Canadian families continue to live in poverty and unemployment . 
the government is not in compliance with its own pay equity legislation . 
while public service executives are getting significant bonuses , many clerks , secretaries and other employees are still not being paid the retroactive payments owed to them . 
i hope the Treasury Board will pay what is owed to these employees and thus fulfill its commitment to female members of the public service and to women in general . 
in order to correct this injustice , we are also asking that a new budget be tabled as early as this fall . 
* * * 
PRINCESS DIANA 
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , death stalks all of us and can be cruel , but never more so than when it takes the life of the young . 
on August 31 the world lost a beautiful soul in the death of Princess Diana . 
and we all grieved . 
we grieved not only for the loss of someone filled with so much promise , but also for someone in whom we saw ourselves . 
she set an example in how to overcome our difficulties . 
she taught us to reach inside ourselves to become something greater than what we are by helping those who are less fortunate . 
Diana championed the plight of sick children , AIDS patients , the terminally ill . 
recently she brought to the front of the world stage the horrors of landmines and their tragic victims . 
as Canadians , we extend our deepest sympathies and prayers to the family of the Princess and especially to her sons , Princes William and Harry . 
* * * 
universit É DU QU É BEC À CHICOUTIMI 
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Friday I had the pleasure of announcing on behalf of the Government of Canada the investment of $ 750,000 over five years , via the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council , in a new industrial engineering chair at the Universit é du Qu é bec à Chicoutimi . 
the professor currently holding that chair , Masoud Farzaneh , will study the impact of freezing rain on power transmission network equipment . 
two industrial partners , Hydro - Quebec and Alcan , have also contributed to the funding of this chair . 
creation of this chair is evidence of the Liberal government ' s desire to work in conjunction with our partners in industry , the universities and provincial agencies to develop new knowledge which will improve electrical service and eliminate power outages caused by precipitation freezing on transmission lines . 
this is further evidence that Canada is working to ensure the success of all Quebecers . 
* * * 
canada PENSION PLAN 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday ' s throne speech gives Canadians every reason to be worried about their future retirement plans . 
older Canadians have earned the right to a secure retirement . 
middle class workers cannot afford to pay more for the same benefits . 
younger Canadians want the CPP to be there when they need it . 
the Liberals plan to fix the CPP will be a further $ 11 billion tax hike on working Canadians and employers if the government refuses to reduce the EI premiums . 
this government has a hidden agenda with the proposed seniors ' benefit . 
it hurts middle income Canadians the most . 
it disproportionately attacks women by basing it on family income and it discourages people to save for their retirement . 
i ask the government to stop punishing Canadians who have worked and saved for their retirement and urge them to put the seniors benefit on hold until there are full consultations on the proposed plan . 
* * * 
mother TERESA 
Ms. Albina Guarnieri ( Mississauga East , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , earlier this month the world lost the moral beacon of the 20 th century . 
Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa led a life that challenged the modern world by teaching us that lifestyle is not more important than life . 
she accumulated no material possessions , shunned political power and never succumbed to moral compromises . 
her life was consumed by the simple goal of providing food , education , medical care , love and hope to the sick and desolate . 
her notion of charity was not to hold black tie fundraisers and send others to do the messy work . 
no , Mother Teresa ' s example was to pick the maggots out of people ' s open wounds herself . 
no human has done so much , for so many , for so little . 
but her life ' s work , not even respect for the dead , could spare her from those who want to protect their world from her message . 
fully half of the media ' s coverage of Mother Teresa ' s death was devoted to criticism of her life and beliefs . 
there are obviously many maggot infested wounds that still need to be cleansed by the millions she inspired . 
she will be remembered simply and affectionately as Mother . 
the Speaker : 
before starting question period I want to share with you some of the intentions developed with the House leaders in consultation with me . 
i know that this is the first day and I will give us all a bit of leeway . 
however , I would like to ask you to consider joining with me in the days and weeks ahead in the following manner . 
it would be my intention to shorten the length of time for both the questions and the answers from what we had in the last Parliament so that , on average , we can have more questions . 
this will mean that the advance statements by the questioners will be shorter . 
i would also ask for the help of the ministers to keep their responses shorter . 
so now we shall see how things go today . 
we will keep track of the time . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
government EXPENDITURES 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to be back in the House , and I am not just talking about Stornoway . 
in his election platform the Prime Minister promised Canadians a 50:50 split between increased spending on one hand and debt and tax reduction on the other . 
yet in yesterday ' s speech from the throne his government listed at least 29 new spending measures , but not one single practical measure for either debt reduction or tax relief . 
was this simply an oversight ? 
did he just leave something out of the speech or does this signal a return to Liberal chequebook spending ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the new Leader of the Opposition in this House . 
we have made a commitment that very soon the country will be in a position to operate with a surplus . 
the budget is scheduled for the month of February . 
we have the time but first we have to go to a zero deficit . 
we had to reduce the disastrous deficit of $ 42 billion left by the Conservative Party . 
every year we are obliged to spend some money on some programs because of the problems in society which need to be taken care of . 
it is always the Liberal approach to care and be responsible to others . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my colleagues and I find it inconceivable that the Department of Finance would truly endorse a return to spending as the number one fiscal priority of the government . 
economists inside and outside the department have been saying for years that the federal government cannot spend its way to lower unemployment and that irresponsible spending and taxation is what is keeping unemployment high . 
has the Prime Minister simply forgotten about the seriousness of the debt or the high tax levels , or is he telling the House that higher spending is the number one fiscal priority of his government ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there are 29 proposals in the throne speech for higher spending and nothing on debt reduction or tax reduction . 
if the government makes higher spending its number one priority , there will be no surpluses . 
therefore 50 per cent of zero is zero , and there is zero for tax relief or debt reduction . 
is not this 50:50 formula simply a shell game , like the GST promise in the previous election , to allow the government to do what it really wants to do , which is to return to excessive spending ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously the Leader of the Opposition does not have anything very concrete on which to attack the government . 
he is setting a target to shoot at . 
we said very clearly we will spend more money when we are in a surplus position . 
at the same time there are problems in society that have to be fixed and we will do it in a responsible way . 
around the world today people look to Canada because we are an example of a fiscally responsible government and , at the same time , a government caring for those who need the most help in our society . 
* * * 
employment 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in February the Minister of Finance said a 5 per cent jobless rate was not only achievable but desirable . 
however , according to his department this is hogwash . 
it is forecasting 9 per cent , 8 per cent next year and 7 per cent until the year 2015 . 
can the minister explain why he is publicly talking about a 5 per cent unemployment rate when privately his department says the opposite ? 
who is right and who is wrong ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is wrong . 
the debate to which the hon. member refers is a discussion over the natural rate of unemployment , the rate at which inflation would take off , and there is , in fact , a difference of opinion . 
this government clearly states that an arbitrary number , like 8 per cent for a NAIRU , is not applicable to a country whose productivity is improving , a country where interest rates are low , a country whose industry has become lean and competitive . 
all I can tell the hon. member is that Alan Greenspan agrees with me and I will take him over the member for Medicine Hat . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in Canada several economists say that the long term natural rate for unemployment is well over the 5 per cent that the minister is talking about . 
under this government my 13 year old son will be middle aged before we get within shouting distance of that 5 per cent target . 
when is the minister going to take the advice of the real job creators and cut taxes ? 
Canadians want tax cuts . 
i would like an answer from the prime minister - in - waiting , please . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it does the member good to be in the official opposition . 
for the first time he understands the real political truths in this country . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
hon. Paul Martin : 
no , not about me , but that they will never make it . 
let me give a couple of numbers . 
in the last four years under this Prime Minister the Canadian public has created over 970,000 new jobs . 
this year under this Prime Minister the Canadian public has created over 260,000 new jobs , the vast majority of those in the private sector . 
under this Prime Minister the youth unemployment rate has started to go down . 
under this Prime Minister the - 
some hon. members : 
more , more . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Governor General read a speech from the Throne that contained a number of particularly moving , even lyrical , passages on Canada in the 21 st century . 
the reality of the matter , however , is quite something else . 
will the Prime Minister not acknowledge that the Speech from the Throne sanctions his vision of Canada , where all major decisions will be made in Ottawa , with the provinces being relegated to the position of subsidiaries of Ottawa , and where Quebecers as a people have no place ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we made frequent reference in the Speech from the Throne to the partnership we want with the provinces . 
we made frequent reference in the Speech from the Throne to what we intend to do for the children of poor families in Canada . 
i would like to make it clear to the former Leader of the Opposition that , at the first ministers ' meeting in June last year , all the provincial governments and premiers in attendance , including the Premier of Quebec , agreed to our establishing a child credit program to help poor families . 
this shows that we can work together within Canada as partners . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister uses the term " partners " because he thinks it is a popular term and would give it the same meaning it was given by the sovereignists . 
however , we have no illusions about this , because when the Prime Minister talks about partnership , it is the kind of partnership in which the political decisions are made in Ottawa and the provinces are asked to carry them out . 
the provinces are being treated like so many municipalities . 
would the Prime Minister agree that the throne speech has demonstrated , more clearly than ever before , that there are two diametrically opposed visions of Canada : one in Quebec where , since Jean Lesage , people have wanted to be " ma î tres chez nous " and one in the rest of Canada , the one in the Calgary declaration where Quebecers are just as unique as Pacific salmon ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the leader of the third party overlooks the fact that we have worked very hard with the provinces since we came to power . 
take , for instance , Quebec ' s traditional demands regarding manpower training . 
we have entered into an agreement with the provincial governments , including the Government of Quebec . 
for many years , the Government of Quebec and the other governments complained that we were involved in areas they would rather see us out of . 
that is why we withdrew from forestry , mining , tourism , social housing and manpower training . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in the Speech from the Throne , the Prime Minister wanted , he said , to launch an appeal to citizens to work together to save Canada , except that nothing about the speech is likely to please Quebec . 
my question is for the Prime Minister . 
will he confirm that his party has buried the concept of distinct society once and for all and replaced it with the concept of " unique character '' ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to point out to the member for Roberval that he voted against distinct society here in this House . 
i also want to point out to the member for Roberval that , when he was an MNA , he voted against the Meech Lake accord in the National Assembly . 
and I am very pleased with the premiers ' attitude in this regard . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in exchanging niceties with the Prime Minister , might I remind him that he was the one who was traipsing all over Quebec during the last election campaign promising Quebecers that he would sell the rest of Canada on the idea of a distinct society , not I. 
is the Prime Minister now telling us that once again he is going to change his story and not fulfil the commitment he made to the voters of Quebec ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have always stressed the necessity of recognizing the distinct character of Quebec because of its language , its culture , and its Civil Code . 
the formula the premiers saw fit to accept a few weeks ago is a new one which describes the Quebec reality , something we continue to fight for , while the Bloc Quebecois , in the House of Commons , and the Parti Quebecois , in the National Assembly , have voted against anything which could accommodate Quebec so as to enable it to prosper within Canada . 
* * * 
employment 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have waited a long time for this moment . 
my question is to the Prime Minister . 
on behalf of 1.4 million unemployed Canadians , will the government commit today to set clear timetables and targets for the reduction of unemployment ? 
the government has done it with respect to deficit reduction . 
when will the government do the same for unemployment and show that it is serious about putting Canadians back to work ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first I would like to welcome the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party to the House of Commons . 
i am happy to have her here . 
i know she has waited a long time and I hope she will stay for a long time too . 
i would like to say that we want to reduce unemployment and we are working very hard on it . 
the first thing we had to do was to put the finances of the nation in order . 
a few years ago we had a deficit of $ 42 billion and very soon we will have reduced it to zero . 
we have to do that in order to create jobs . 
when there is no inflation , low interest rates and a competitive dollar , we can produce and be very competitive . 
it is in that way that we will create the jobs . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is obvious that 155 Liberal cheerleaders over there are pretty pleased with their record . 
since the last Liberal throne speech promised to tackle youth unemployment , 26,000 more young people in this country have not been able to find jobs and they are not cheering . 
if not , will it admit that it has simply given up doing anything to help the young people who most desperately need its help ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have tried to explain in a few words that we must have the basic elements to create jobs in the country . 
it is not by spending money that we will cure the problems of the nation . 
we have to do it in a responsible way and we have to put the books of the nation in order . 
i would like to quote some advice I read on February 10 of this year . 
it was said that we have come too far and have worked too hard to restart the cycle of careless spending . 
therefore , we will not follow the advice of the leader of the New Democratic Party . 
we will follow the advice of Mr. Roy Romanow who spoke in front of the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce . 
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) : 
his government said in the Speech from the Throne that it cares about unemployment in general and about youth unemployment in particular . 
the government could take concrete action immediately by reducing employment insurance premiums . 
this is what the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , as well as Quebec ' s Chamber of Commerce and Conseil du patronat , are asking for . 
what is this government waiting for to end this abuse and put people back to work ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I wish to welcome the Conservative Party leader , who is now back in the front row . 
we are happy to see him and look forward to be closer to him and to see him more often than in the last Parliament . 
the Conservative Party leader should know that , when we came to office , the unemployment insurance fund showed an enormous deficit , because the Conservative government had not exercised prudence . 
the Conservatives had to increase premiums from $ 2 to $ 3.30 , at a time when unemployment was on the rise in Canada . 
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the Prime Minister for his kind words in welcoming me back to the House . 
i would caution him against wishing that I be here too often and remind him of the old Chinese proverb that he may end up getting what he wishes for . 
today I want to offer the Prime Minister a great opportunity , an opportunity to do something for unemployed Canadians and young unemployed Canadians . 
if he acts today he can put thousands of people back to work in the next few weeks by reducing employment insurance premiums , this tax , this rip - off on Canadians to the tune of billions of dollars . 
to be clear , I want to ask the Prime Minister one simple , straightforward question . 
does he and his government believe that this employment insurance system should be used for the purpose of reducing the deficit , yes or no ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we did not want to run the affairs of the nation the way that the previous government did . 
it never had any surplus in the unemployment insurance fund . 
we want to act as prudent managers in order to make sure that our financial situation is good in Canada and that we have low interest rates . 
we have that now and that is what is creating the 4 per cent growth that we will have this year in Canada . 
we are the leaders of the G - 7 countries in this .

throne SPEECH 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the equality of citizens and provinces became a huge factor and played a large part in the Calgary premiers conference last week . 
in fact their framework for discussion listed the word equality five times . 
yet yesterday in the throne speech we did not hear the word equality even once ; uniqueness , diversity , all kinds of words , but not equality . 
my question for the Prime Minister is in yesterday ' s throne speech why in the world was the equality of citizens and provinces deliberately left out ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when we said we want to work in partnership and in collaboration with the provinces it is because we believe in equality . 
that is exactly the purpose of it . 
about the equality of individuals , I do not have any lessons to receive from the hon. member for Edmonton North because I was the minister of justice who gave the charter of rights to all citizens of Canada to make them equal . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the concept of equality and the word equality is what is important . 
speaking of justice ministers , it is a wonder that this justice minister did not notice the absence of the word equality and insist that it be put in the throne speech . 
it is very strange that the government would mention the unique character of Quebec society and the diversity inherent in the federation and yet not mention equality . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is something I have talked about and lived by for the last 34 years that I have been a member of Parliament . 
this is very important . 
equality means that we recognize the people for what they are . 
in a family equality means that sometimes we have to have solutions that are meeting the needs in one part of Canada but which are not needed elsewhere . 
we have , for example , despite equality a terrible problem of poverty in Canada . 
this means that those who are rich have to help those who are poor . 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for T é miscamingue . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Prime Minister . 
in the throne speech we heard that the federal government , as its financial position improves , intends to intervene increasingly in areas of provincial jurisdiction , including health and education . 
how can the Prime Minister justify increasing involvement by its government in health and education , considering that these areas have always been the responsibility of provincial governments ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canada happens to be one of the most decentralized federations in the world , and together we have built a federation that has provided us with the best quality of life of any country . 
and we managed to do this because both levels of government , federal and provincial , are learning to work together and to concentrate on the areas for which they are responsible . 
in the health sector , the federal government ' s responsibilities are those that are recognized in the Constitution . 
there is nothing unconstitutional about having five moral principles that are accepted throughout Canada , including Quebec , and as a result can be applied anywhere in Canada , both in the wealthiest and the less wealthy provinces . 
i may remind the hon. member that the province that benefits the most per capita from the Canada Social Transfer happens to be Quebec . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is the first time a federal government has so clearly indicated its intention of interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction , especially education . 
would the Prime Minister or his minister agree that his program to measure the readiness of children to learn is , in fact , a foot in the door of the education sector , with all the consequences that involves : federal programs , federal assessment criteria , federal employees , and on top of that , taxpayers who will again pay twice as a result of this latest duplication ? 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am always amazed by the excessive reactions we get from that side of the House . 
however , if they get their kicks by measuring the orthodoxy of every word , by all means , let them make a study of semantics . 
what we promised in the throne speech yesterday was to let Canadians benefit from a study by Statistics Canada , for which my department is responsible . 
i am referring to a national longitudinal survey we have been doing for several years . 
since we invest enormous amounts of money in the well - being of our children , we feel it is very important to measure their progress , so that when they go to school , they are in the best possible position to learn .

national UNITY 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , except for Premier Bouchard , who did not attend the Calgary conference , all of Canada ' s provincial premiers agreed to put the question on national unity to the Canadian people . 
does the Prime Minister think it is acceptable for Quebecers to be the only Canadians who will not be consulted on national unity ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for his question . 
right now , the provincial governments have made a joint decision to consult the people before adopting resolutions in their respective legislatures . 
in the case of Quebec , the present government of Quebec is not interested in consulting Quebecers on their genuine participation within Canada . 
right now , the provinces have decided to consult their citizens before adopting their resolution . 
as soon as Quebec wants to adopt its resolution , I would ask the Government of Quebec to do likewise . 
as far as we are concerned , if these resolutions are passed or adopted by all the provinces , I said before that the House of Commons has voted on distinct society , and we are prepared to vote on the words chosen by the premiers after a debate in this House . 
but we will have to wait and see what happens in the provinces , which are working on this right now . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Mr. Bouchard has said that he will not take part in any public consultation process . 
Meech Lake and Charlottetown failed because Canadians were not consulted . 
knowing this , will the prime minister clarify how the Calgary declaration will be communicated to the people of Quebec and by whom ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with due respect to the hon. member , on Charlottetown people were consulted . 
there was a referendum . 
among the reforms that we favoured was the election of the Senate . 
the Reform Party voted against it . 
at this moment the provinces are doing their work . 
in due course we will act . 
i have talked with the premiers and they are doing , in a very different way , the way they want , their own consultations before they vote on the issue . 
we do not want to duplicate that in the other provinces . 
at this moment there is no debate going on before the national assembly on the question of the Calgary declaration . 
when there is a debate I hope they will consult with the people . 
if need be we might consult with them , but at this moment the timing is not appropriate .

speech FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the throne speech , the government claims to be sensitive to the problems of low income families with children and the problems in the education and health case systems . 
my question is for the Minister of Finance . 
does the Minister of Finance admit that the problems the government has identified in these areas are basically due to the cuts of over $ 40 billion it made during its first mandate and intends to keep on making during this mandate ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , because of the efforts made by this government , and indeed all Canadians , in terms of putting our fiscal house in order , the government can now afford to provide assistance to society ' s most disadvantaged , namely poor children . 
in fact , our intentions were not expressed only in the throne speech . 
judging from recent budgets and the actions taken by my colleague , the Minister of Human Resources Development , and by other colleagues regarding the child tax credit , internship programs and all this government has put in place for the poor in this country , it is very clear that what our government intends to do is to help Canadians , not to divide them . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the axeman seldom woos his victims , but that is what the Minister of Finance is doing , since he is responsible for poverty in Canada . 
by the way , will the minister admit that his solution to health , education and poverty problems is to cut $ 42 billion instead of $ 48 billion as initially planned ? 
in other words , all he has to offer as a solution is to cut $ 6 billion less than he had planned . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I suggest that the hon. member across the way , where he was before the election , compare the first Campeau budget tabled when the Parti Quebecois took office in Quebec with the forecast now being made by Mr. Landry . 
he will see that , thanks to federal activities and initiatives , the amount available to Mr. Landry to help the disadvantaged is $ 1.5 billion higher than originally planned by Mr. Campeau . 
i do hope the PQ government will use this money to help the most disadvantaged in Quebec .

health CARE 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when the health minister was recently asked where he would find the money for national pharmacare , he replied : " I don ' t know but it ' s a really good idea '' . 
when patients are trapped in the longest waiting lines in history why would anybody be thinking about a brand new national program ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the first and fundamental challenge we face with our health care system , and I know the hon. member is aware of this , is restoring the confidence of Canadians in the basic medicare which we have come to know and depend on . 
the government is firmly committed to not only the five principles of the Canada Health Act but to working with our partners in the provinces , with providers and with other stakeholders in the system to restore the health system to the quality Canadians expect and deserve . 
that is going to mean a lot of work . 
it is going to mean working with provinces and others to tackle issues such as waiting lists . 
it is going to mean dealing with - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Macleod . 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
i call that clueless . 
medicare has suffered and lies wounded . 
why would anybody carry on with a brand new program like this when medicare itself needs to be fixed ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I know the hon. member is a better doctor than he is a mathematician . 
he knows full well that the cuts by this government were nowhere near 40 per cent . 
what I said to my provincial partners is that we are going to work toward pharmacare as a long term goal because this government believes that in the long term the partners should work with us in creating a system where every citizen of this country should have access to the drugs they need and should not be kept from them because of price .

employment INSURANCE 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
the Liberal government has cut unemployment insurance by billions of dollars , turning a deaf ear to the cries of alarm coming from the unemployed and from seasonal workers . 
how can the minister justify a throne speech that contains nothing at all for the unemployed and for seasonal workers , when he knows that the unemployment insurance fund will again this year produce a surplus of at least $ 7 billion ? 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member will have to take another look at the throne speech , because there are several references to what we are going to do and have been doing for some time now . 
in particular , we announced a youth employment strategy , which is extremely important . 
we are working very hard on the unemployment issue and you know it . 
this strategy , which creates work experience , is doing well . 
we have identified tools that worked well and we will consolidate and extend them so that the work experience young people need to make the transition from school to the work place is a very positive one . 
there is also the transitional job creation fund , $ 95 million of which has been invested in job creation in Quebec . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is very clear from the minister ' s reply that he is not in the least concerned about the plight of seasonal and other workers entering the job market . 
my question is not what he is doing to help them re - enter the job market , but what he is doing to help them survive and not all end up on welfare . 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are very concerned about the situation the member describes and I would appreciate it if he listened to the reply , because it is important that he tell his constituents and all those living in his riding what to do . 
we have set up a transitional job creation fund . 
we do not believe in passive income support . 
that is what our workers want . 
* * * 
immigration 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
a new American law requiring Canadians crossing into the United States to undergo a lengthy and invasive inspection process could have disastrous effects on Sault Ste. Marie tourism and the normal flow of business between our city and its American neighbours . 
what steps is the federal government taking to ensure Canadians will continue to have easy access to the United States ? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the new measures announced by the United States are extremely damaging to Canadian and to American business . 
they are counter to the initiatives taken by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister to dismantle controls at borders and to promote the free circulation of people and of goods . 
they are probably counter to NAFTA . 
our objective is to secure the removal of those controls from application at the Canada - U.S. border . 
we are encouraged already in our efforts by the amendments introduced by a member of the United States Senate and a member of the United States Congress to this effect . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government has made a mess of the Pacific salmon dispute . 
we have seen four years of mismanagement on this file . 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member ' s assertion is incorrect . 
the issue , however , of the salmon treaty is an important one . 
i am disappointed the fisheries critic of the official opposition would choose for his first question such a trivial , irrelevant and inaccurate comment as the one he has made . 
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech contains not one word about resolving the Pacific salmon dispute . 
the government continues to show a lack of commitment to British Columbia . 
will the minister make resolving the treaty by January 31 the number one priority of his department ? 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are again hearing questioning by Reform members who obviously have not read the throne speech or listened to it . 
the fact is that in the throne speech there is a clear commitment to continue to deal with the issue of foreign overfishing . 
if the fisheries critic of the official opposition knew something about the problem of the Pacific salmon treaty , he would know that it began because the Alaskans overfished Canadian bound sockeye salmon in northern British Columbia going to the Nass and Skeena Rivers , to the tune of three times what they had done previously under the treaty . 
that is what he has not understood and he has not understood that the throne speech addresses it directly .

petitions 
health AND DRUG ACT 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present three petitions on the same subject that vary a bit . 
each of them calls on the government to reject proposed changes to the Canada Health and Drug Act that would prevent people from taking dietary supplements or herbal goods of their own choice . 
national HIGHWAYS 
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my congratulations on your re - election , Sir . 
i have two petitions to present today . 
the first petition is signed by 30 of my constituents and calls upon Parliament to urge the federal government to join with the provincial governments in making the national highway system upgrading possible beginning in 1997 . 
criminal CODE 
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is signed by 57 of my constituents . 
it calls upon Parliament to enact legislation to amend the Criminal Code , specifically sections 173 and 174 , the indecent act and public nudity provisions , to clearly state that a woman exposing her breasts in a public place is an indecent act . 
co - OPERATIVES 
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure today to present a petition on behalf of 57 constituents who live in a co - op housing project on 610 Beatrice Street in my riding . 
in part they indicate that the Government of Canada and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation have begun secret negotiations with the province of Ontario , that the people who own and operate co - operatives have been excluded from these negotiations , and that the Government of Ontario has already breached its own agreements with provincially funded housing co - operatives . 
they pray that the minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing will immediately suspend negotiations on social housing with the province of Ontario and resume negotiations only if the minister proceeds under publicly declared principles established with the input of the co - operative housing stakeholders .

government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
first I congratulate you on your re - election to the Chair . 
i extend best wishes to you on behalf of the members of the official opposition . 
we wish you patience and wisdom in your deliberations in guiding our deliberations and express the hope that the spirit of democracy expressed on the first day you were elected will continue throughout this Parliament . 
congratulations to you , Sir , on behalf of all of us . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
we would like to congratulate the hon. member for Laurier - Sainte - Marie , the leader of the Bloc Quebecois , and his colleagues on their election . 
while we disagree profoundly with the policies of the Bloc , we respect the democratic process that permitted the election of Bloc members to this House . 
we will continue to try to convince them and their electors that real reform of the federation is possible and preferable to separation from it . 
to the hon. member for Halifax and our NDP colleagues we extend congratulations as well . 
i also ask the leader of the NDP to convey our best wishes to her predecessor , Ms. Audrey McLaughlin . 
so often members leave the Chamber of their own accord after serving their time with little acknowledgement or recognition . 
i ask members to simply join in applauding Ms. McLaughlin for her hard work , her compassion and her contribution to Canada . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. Preston Manning : 
i congratulate the leader of the Conservative Party and his colleagues . 
i congratulate the Right Hon. Prime Minister . 
he has had a long career in politics . 
we were attempting to terminate it a little earlier but we were not quite successful . 
Jason Moscovitz on the night of the election said that the member for Sherbrooke won the leaders debate , that Reform won the campaign but that the Prime Minister won the election . 
we would have preferred his victory to ours . 
i would also like to congratulate the prime minister and his gracious wife Aline on their 40 th wedding anniversary a few weeks ago . 
if she can put up with the prime minister for 40 years I guess we can put up with him for another four . 
to all hon. members I would like to extend congratulations on elections and re - elections . 
i would like to say to all the younger MPs and to the new MPs that we wish to encourage them . 
i think they can bring invigoration and a fresh spirit to this institution which sometimes shows signs of age . 
i would encourage all members to encourage these new members and to give them the respect they deserve . 
they do represent really the vanguard of the future and we welcome them to this House . 
last of all but not least I want to acknowledge and thank the people of Calgary Southwest . 
as I have frequently said to them , this seat in my judgment does not belong to me . 
it does not belong to my party . 
it is their seat . 
turning to more important business , on June 2 over 12 million Canadians participated in the federal election . 
when the ballots were counted the seats were allocated , whether we like it or not , the way we see them in the House . 
it seems to me at the outset it would be important to ask ourselves precisely what did Canadians do on June 2 and what message were they endeavouring to send by what they did . 
i suggest they were saying four things . 
first , they reduced the representation of the both the government party and the official opposition of the last Parliament ; fewer seats for the Liberals and fewer seats for the Bloc . 
there is a message in that of dissatisfaction . 
it was not enough dissatisfaction to upset the government but it was dissatisfaction that the government needs to heed . 
second , the public increased support for three very different parties , the Reform Party , the NDP and the Progressive Conservatives . 
there is a message in that . 
the public is searching for different ideas and different personalities to represent different realities in the country . 
that is one the public wants to see , for better or for worse , reflected in the House . 
it is incumbent on us to reflect that . 
the third is one of the most interesting things . 
when historians write about the 1997 election I think this is one of the things they will single out . 
the Canadian people regionalized this Chamber in a way that they have not done for a long time . 
if we look at the votes , while Reform got one million votes east of the Manitoba - Ontario border , all our seats are in the west . 
the Bloc is exclusively a Quebec party . 
even within Quebec its vote is regionalized primarily in the area east of Montreal . 
the NDP is divided between members in Atlantic Canada , in the west , but with no seats at all in central Canada . 
the Progressive Conservatives have 90 per cent of their seats east of Ontario , with a majority in Atlantic Canada . 
while the Conservatives will continue to represent themselves as a national party in the House they are in essence an Atlantic party with a Quebec contingent . 
for the government of course two - thirds of its seats are in Ontario , with half of the remainder in Quebec . 
while in theory it too is a national party , or claims to be a national party , in fact in the House it is an Ontario party with a Quebec contingent . 
if there is a lesson in this , it is that this country continues to pay a price for failing to reform the upper house . 
in Germany , Australia , the United States and in other big federations of the world regional interests are expressed in their federal arenas through an effective upper chamber . 
when you do not have that one of the consequences is a regionalization of your lower house . 
those who think regionalization of this House is a backward step or something that will hurt national unity should join the ranks of those who demand an effective upper chamber to represent regional interests . 
the fourth thing that Canadians did in 1997 was allow a 10 year old federal party , with roots in the west and proud of it , and with aspirations to become a truly national party , to occupy the role of official opposition and to become the alternative to the government . 
as we begin that new role and analyse the Speech from the Throne , we owe it to the public to share with it how we see this role being discharged . 
we see ourselves as having a twofold mandate . 
the first is to hold the government accountable , to commend it on actions which we consider in the national interests but to criticize it on actions which we consider not to be in the national interests . 
second , we see our role as one of proposing constructive alternatives consistent with the big themes of equality , accountability and fiscal responsibility on which our members were elected . 
in relation to the Speech from the Throne I would like to perform these two functions . 
i want to commend the government where it deserves commendation . 
we want to criticize the features of the speech which we consider inadequate . 
most important , we want to present constructive alternatives where we see those deficiencies . 
as the Speech from the Throne remarked , the 36 th Parliament of Canada is a transition Parliament . 
it is the last Parliament of the 20 th century and the first of the 21 st century . 
therefore people can ask in which direction it is going to look . 
is it going to continually look back over its shoulder at old ideas and concepts from the past or is it going to squarely face the future ? 
the throne speech professes to look ahead . 
it is important that we look at the reality behind the words . 
i see a great historical and political analogy between the end of the 19 th century politically and the end of the 20 th century . 
by the end of the 19 th century the governing party , the Conservative Party , had run out of leadership , ideas and energy . 
it had run out of steam . 
Macdonald , the guiding light , was gone . 
the lesser lights , though well meaning , who took his place were unable to build on the foundation which he had laid . 
once new ideas , such as the federal union , the national policy or the transcontinental railway , were by that point in time the status quo . 
as J . Arthur Lower the historian put it , the once vital era of Macdonald sputtered to a dreary conclusion after the death of its guiding spirit . 
while an exhausted government was still running the country , Canada itself was bursting with the new ideas , new energies and new potentials of the 20 th century , and while the government was mired in the past , the people started to seek ways and means to express their frustrations with a government whose time had past . 
with their desire to see new ideas expressed in the federal arena they started to search for new personalities and new groups . 
the personality they settled on was Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the new group of MPs around him . 
the throne speech quotes Sir Wilfrid Laurier . 
he was talking about fiscal realities . 
he described Canada not as a country led and inspired by government policy but as a young giant shackled and manacled by government policy . 
he said about the need for a fresh start : " I say that the time has come for gentlemen on the other side to cease their boasting and self - glorification and for the people of the country to open their eyes and see that a new departure must be made from the policy which has been followed for the last 10 years . 
i have said that a change has become absolutely necessary to the well - being of the country '' . 
sir Wilfrid Laurier on the weakness of the previous government ' s legislative program in a debate on the speech from the throne , precisely like this , said : " The speech from the throne has been for some years past a very dry skeleton . 
this year it is drier than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with an ominous sound '' . 
i see a striking parallel between the end of the 19 th century politically and the end of the 20 th . 
the once great Liberal Party is running out of steam . 
the throne speech , despite forward looking language , offers no brilliant illumination of the horizon of the new millennium . 
there is no connection to the forces of innovation and change and reform that are at large in the country which if harnessed to national policy will help propel Canada into the 21 st century with vigour and optimism . 
i say in applying glorious analogy to this throne speech , it is a dry bone speech lacking in the flesh and blood and muscle and sinew and heart and soul required to inspire Canadians for the 21 st century . 
i would apply the words exactly : " The speech from the throne has been for some years a very dry skeleton . 
this year is drier than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with an ominous sound '' . 
with this sobering historical parallel and Laurier ' s analogy before us let us analyse the government ' s speech from the throne . 
we want to examine the dry bones . 
we want to give credit where credit is due . 
as any dog will tell you , a dry bone is better than no bone at all . 
where deficiencies exist what we will endeavour to do is not simply to be critical but to offer new ideas that can perhaps turn this dry bones throne speech into something vibrant and new and appropriate to leading the country into the 21 st century . 
let me look first at the economy . 
the government proposes little with respect to the economy . 
it mentions none of the resource sectors . 
it mentions nothing about the manufacturing sector . 
it does mention investing in knowledge and creativity . 
we find all the government ' s references to high technology tiresome because the rhetoric is there and yet we cannot even get electronic voting in this House . 
let us start practising high tech if we believe in high tech and not just talking about it . 
the principal argument in the government ' s throne speech with respect to facilitating economic recovery is that it now has the deficit under control . 
when we first came here in 1993 our analysis was that the federal financial vehicle had four flat tires . 
one of them was the deficit , one was that spending was out of control , one was the debt out of control , the other was taxes out of control . 
we do not think the timetable was right but at least one of those tires is now getting close to being in good shape . 
the question is what to do about the other three tires . 
in the speech from the throne there is virtually little or nothing on the subject of how to fix the problem of the debt and how to fix the problem of excessive taxation and how to ensure that future spending will not get out of control the way it did in the past . 
we ask where are the commitments in this speech from the throne to debt reduction targets and tax reduction targets ? 
where are the principles that will guide us on these issues ? 
does the government have a view on what is the optimal size of government , on what is the optimal revenue that it should be taking out of the economy ? 
does it have a view on what is the optimal debt size for a government of this nature in this type of a country ? 
my colleague , the member for Medicine Hat , has been circulating a discussion paper entitled " Beyond a Balanced Budget '' . 
what he is finding and what we have found for the last three years is that there are all kinds of ideas out there in the country , with the think tanks , with the business people who have had to rationalize these problems within their companies or they would go under , with younger Canadians who have been thinking about these things because it is their future that is jeopardized . 
the tragedy is that very little of that thinking is seen at all in the government ' s program or in the speech from the throne . 
my colleagues in their discussion of the speech from the throne and in legislation that comes before this House will endeavour to bring that muscle , sinew , tissue , spirit and body required to add some substance to the dry bones on economic recovery contained in the throne speech . 
let me talk for a moment about the social safety net . 
the government to its credit acknowledges that the social safety net is frayed , that we are in trouble with respect to health care , with respect to pensions , with respect to child poverty and in some respects with regard to education . 
we agree with that assessment . 
however , in the throne speech there is only dry bones , administrative tinkering to deal with the problems of these programs . 
the social safety net in our judgment requires a new approach . 
it requires acknowledgement that the frontline caregivers in this country , mothers , fathers , families , and services given by governments closer to the people are the elements of social safety nets that need to be strengthened by government policy . 
where is the recognition in the speech from the throne that many government initiated social programs , no matter how well meaning they would be , are simply no longer affordable , no longer workable and no longer even supported by the clients that they were intended to serve . 
the speech from the throne refers to children but it seems to refer to children as if they were disembodied spirits not connected in any way , shape or form with families . 
in fact they are in most cases connected with families , many of them in desperate straits . 
the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill and other of our colleagues will be advancing some new principles and ideas for real social reform in the days ahead . 
we do not just criticize the government ' s attempts to patch up a creaking welfare state . 
we think that there are new ideas that involve personalizing , decentralizing and localizing social service delivery that can offer more hope to people in the future . 
that will be our contribution to this throne speech debate in the area of social reform . 
with respect to criminal justice , we look at the speech from the throne and we ask what happened to the new justice minister ' s new tough agenda on criminal justice that was announced in August . 
she was going to do something to tighten up the Young Offenders Act . 
she was going to have parole reform . 
yet there is absolutely nothing on that in the speech from the throne at all . 
the one sentencing measure actually made sentencing easier rather than tougher . 
where is the response to the needs of victims of crime ? 
i think of the families of the victims of Clifford Olson and what they have endured as a result of the faint hope clause . 
did the government not feel any twinge of conscience in seeing those people watch Clifford Olson parade passed the cameras on his way to a parole hearing ? 
our hearts go out to them . 
i feel like apologizing to them on behalf of at least part of this Parliament for our inability to prevent them from suffering the pain that they did . 
where is the government ' s response to families that suffer and are at risk because of violence and because of defects in the Young Offenders Act , defects in the parole system , defects in the court system and defects in the penal system ? 
i think of the member for Surrey North , himself a victim of crime with the murder of his son , and how he has struggled and fought to get to this House so he could represent victims . 
it would have been better , Mr. Prime Minister , to have not had that section in the speech than to have it there with such a bare bones agenda . 
my colleagues , particularly the member for Crowfoot and others interested in criminal justice reform on the Reform side , will endeavour to remedy this deficiency in the government ' s legislative program by proposing reforms , particularly those that put the rights of victims ahead of anything else . 
with respect to accountability , members who were here in 1993 will remember that the throne speech referred on numerous occasions to integrity , to ethics , to ethics commissioners , to guidelines for ministers , to accountability . 
we cannot help but notice in this year ' s throne speech that element is completely missing . 
in no way does the government accept responsibility for political interference with the Somalia inquiry . 
in no way does it acknowledge its responsibilities in that area and agree to implement the recommendations of that aborted inquiry . 
we see no acceptance of responsibility by the government in stonewalling the Krever inquiry . 
it was all for that inquiry as long as it was looking into the misdeeds of the Tory government . 
as soon as it started to get back to the period before that , the government stonewalled the inquiry . 
yet there is not a flicker of recognition in the speech from the throne of that desire for accountability , not even a willingness to look at some of the mechanisms that can be used to hold people more accountable : greater use of referenda mechanisms ; greater use of citizens initiatives ; treating petitions with respect instead of parading them here in the House and storing them in the basement the next day never to see light again . 
in speaking on the speech from the throne , one of the things that we will endeavour to add to the non - existent skeleton of public accountability is a proposal for making this chamber and its members , not just ourselves but all members , more accountable to the people whom we serve . 
lastly I want to turn to the never ending subject of national unity . 
i note that the government has made some modest changes in its approach to national unity , small steps I suggest , but in the right direction . 
in 1995 prior to the last referendum the government was completely unwilling to challenge the legality of a unilateral secession . 
it was unwilling to address with frankness and clarity the practical , hard questions that arise when some province decides to secede ; issues like boundaries , debt allocation , what happens to minorities who do not want to remain in the seceding province , et cetera . 
not only did the government not have that on its agenda , but it castigated as traitors to the unity effort those who insisted such questions be dealt with and that such consequences be communicated to the people of Quebec . 
until recently the government has also been putting all its unity eggs in one basket , a basket with a hole in it . 
it has been relying on the distinct society clause to move public opinion in Quebec , despite the fact that that has been tried before and despite the lack of support elsewhere in the country for that approach . 
that was the government ' s position in 1995 . 
as I say , we see now some modest changes . 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , to his credit , is starting to address the negative consequences of secession and we commend his efforts . 
the government appears to be accepting some advice from the premiers , although we question this based on the Prime Minister ' s replies in question period today . 
however , we thought there was some movement in accepting the inadequacies of the distinct society clause and accepting the premiers ' view that the language has to be changed and the concept has to be changed . 
the concept should be changed by marrying it to the principle of equality and making crystal clear that any recognition of uniqueness in Quebec or elsewhere , a uniqueness that we applaud , will not confer on one province powers not conferred on another . 
these changes are far too small . 
they do not add up to a fresh vigorous vision or federalist initiative to unite the country for the 21 st century . 
they are just a skeleton , dry bones rattling against each other . 
if the government desires to clothe the skeleton of its national unity strategy with real spirit , substance and muscle , I would urge it to start accepting more substantive proposals from other quarters beginning with the premiers . 
let me mention what some of these would be . 
the section in the throne speech on unity is extremely brief . 
it contains only one paragraph recognizing the work of the premiers in Calgary on September 14 . 
the paragraph reads : 
the government will work closely with provincial and territorial governments to further advance the progress made by nine premiers and the territorial leaders last week in Calgary toward the full recognition of the diversity inherent in the federation , including the unique character of Quebec society . 
we have no quarrel with that . 
however , it completely ignores what they said about equality of citizens and provinces , and it completely ignores the subject to which they devoted three - quarters of their communique , namely a process to involve the public at the front end of the consideration of any proposals having to do with national unity . 
the official opposition urges the federal government to pay more attention to what premiers and Reformers have said on both equality and on public participation . 
the premiers ' framework of principles for discussion mentioned equality five times . 
in the throne speech the government uses a hundred adjectives to describe Canada but it does not make one single mention of the equality of citizens and provinces . 
if the government thinks it can develop a unity position that ignores the principle of equality of citizens and provinces and more importantly , ignores practical measures to make it workable in the real world , which involves getting equality into the exercise of the federal spending and taxing powers , if the government thinks it can ignore that principle , it will be designing a unity position that will not be acceptable to millions of Canadians . 
why take that chance on the unity issue ? 
we also say if we take the premiers seriously that the government should develop a deeper commitment to public consultation on unity initiatives . 
it could start by doing two things . 
it could start by assuring this House that it will respect the output of the public consultations the premiers are initiating in their provinces even if it does not agree with all the points that are raised . 
lack of meaningful public involvement was the single greatest weakness of past constitutional efforts . 
it marred the 1982 Constitution . 
the public ' s view was that it was after the fact consultation . 
Meech was just packaged up in a slightly different form . 
Spicer went out across the country and came up with dozens and dozens of recommendations , not one of which really found its way into the Charlottetown accord . 
we Canadians , in pursuit of national unity , have been like a family packed into the family car trying to get to a destination called united Canada . 
but so far the only people who get to drive the car are old line politicians and leaders . 
but what has been our experience ? 
for a number of years we let Mr. Trudeau drive the car . 
everyone remembers Trudeau , one hand on the wheel - he was a great cavalier driver - and the other hand out the window giving the finger to Alberta and other places . 
we forgive him in retrospect . 
Canadians in the back are asking " Have we got to a united Canada ? " 
and what did Trudeau say ? 
in fact Levesque was getting car sick in the back and tried kick out the window . 
then we got another driver , Prime Minister Mulroney . 
Canadians in the back were asking " Are we at a united Canada yet ? " 
and he said " No , but it is just over there by Meech Lake . " 
so we go to Meech Lake and we are not at united Canada . 
he said " No , it is at Charlottetown . " 
we go to Charlottetown and we are not at united Canada yet . 
a little later our current Prime Minister gets to drive the car . 
he drives very , very slowly . 
and we are in the back asking " Are we at united Canada ? 
Mr. Prime Minister , are we there yet ? 
the distinguishing characteristic of all these drivers , and every male member of the House can identify with this , they never stop to ask instructions about how to drive . 
we are saying that if we stop to ask instructions that the public has good sense of where a united Canada lies . 
what is even more important is that the public gets a kick at the cat at the front end because if they do not they are going to reject whatever package we come up with no matter how well it is conceived . 
what are some of the other things that maybe should be in a national unity initiative that really address where the public ' s mind is at ? 
i suggest one of the other ingredients which the premiers are starting to talk about is a rebalancing of the powers and also institutional change . 
we had a meeting of our little caucus unity team just this week . 
if we had been writing the speech from the throne and wanted to demonstrate to Canadians that we had some substances behind our unity proposals , what would have been in our legislative package that might have sent that signal ? 
i have a list two pages long . 
we would have had a bill expressly recognizing equality of citizens of provinces and applying that principle to the exercise of the federal spending and taxation power . 
some day in the House I would like to discuss in detail the inequality that exists in the country with respect to the exercise of the federal spending and taxing powers . 
we would have had a bill with statutory adjustments respecting provincial jurisdiction over natural resources , respecting provincial jurisdiction over worker training , respecting provincial jurisdiction over social services , respecting provincial jurisdiction over housing , respecting provincial jurisdiction over tourism . 
we do not regard , nor do most of the provinces regard , mere administrative agreements which vary from province to province and do not exist in half of the provinces , as being anywhere near recognition of provincial responsibility in these areas . 
we would enact bills to strengthen the economic and Canadian union . 
where is the bill from the government to establish a mechanism to beat down internal barriers to trade ? 
this House has the power to pass that bill whether the provinces agree with it or not . 
where is an act to facilitate the development of national standards ? 
that does not mean we will not have national standards or that people do not want them , but we need a new mechanism for the federal government to facilitate national standards for interprovincial agreement . 
i look at the speech from the throne and if I were an aboriginal person I would not pick it up . 
there is nothing in it that really addresses the problems of aboriginal people . 
where is the bill that starts to decentralize and ultimately do away with the department of Indian affairs and transfers functions and funding to local aboriginal governments ? 
where is the parallel bill ? 
they will never get that bill accepted even by rank and file aboriginal people unless there is a parallel bill establishing mechanisms for financial accountability and democratic accountability on reserves . 
where are the bills and motions to strengthen the regional sensitivity and accountability of national institutions ? 
where is the motion in the House to amend the standing orders so that the defeat of a government motion does not result in the defeat of the government unless specifically designated a vote of non - confidence ? 
that would allow more regional representation in this House than it has ever enjoyed . 
where is a non - constitutional Senate reform amendment , at least to make the place elected ? 
where is the constitutional resolution to at least start the Senate reform process ? 
where is representation by population in this House ? 
where is the bill to get that ? 
if the upper House was regionalized we could have genuine representation by population in this House and it would be different in the upper House . 
where is the bill to provide for constituent assemblies if and when this country ever decides to completely write its Constitution ? 
this House is supposed to be looking ahead . 
we cannot wait until the day when Canadians finally decide they want to rewrite the Constitution to start setting the mechanism up . 
we should set the mechanisms up in advance . 
two mechanisms are needed . 
one is a bill for constituent assemblies , the other is an ironclad guarantee of constitutional referenda at the end of the day . 
they add up to a Canada that has the institutional arrangements to make that practical . 
they add up to a new division of powers for the 21 st century . 
there is none of that in this speech from the throne . 
to add breadth and depth to national unity strategies we ask where are the policy initiatives to address the big regional concerns that are so apparent in this House ? 
if the federal government had been truly consulting Canadians it would be acutely aware of our regional differences . 
i said at the outset that this House more accurately expresses some of those regional differences than many House have in the past . 
i was frankly surprised when I first opened the speech from the throne that some of the big headings were not the regional interests of the country . 
where in the speech from the throne is the new Atlantic Canadian economic initiative , one that recognizes that the approaches of the past , the subsidies and handouts and that type of thing , are simply not working ? 
where is the economic initiative that uses the new tools of expanding trade , of beating down internal barriers to trade , of expanding trade with New England and of making Atlantic Canada the gateway to European trade with the American community ? 
where is the proposal for public - private partnerships to build roads and short line railways and container ports ? 
there is nothing in this speech about the new ideas that are out there and nothing related to Atlantic Canada . 
i ask where is the new vision for Quebec , the troisi è me voie ? In this throne speech there is no fresh vision for Quebec . 
with all the new Ontario members in this House , surely in caucus they must have been looking for an open invitation from the federal government to develop a co - ordinated fiscal policy to sustain the economic recovery in Ontario . 
we simply cannot have the biggest government in the country , this government , and the government of the biggest province in the country , Ontario , pursuing fiscal policies that are either going in opposite directions or at 90 ° to one another . 
you could not think of a way to hinder economic recovery better than that . 
you cannot have Ontario with the priority of tax relief and the federal government having the priority to spend . 
the danger to the investor is he sees that whatever tax relief Ontario gives , the federal government will move in to that tax room and the taxpayer will never see it . 
what about the north , our last frontier , demographically and ecologically ? 
there is no recognition of the north , no vision of the north . 
even Diefenbaker had a vision of the north . 
he did not have much substance but he tried to get a vision of the north . 
the north is completely neglected , left as a distant ward of the federal government , ignored or forgotten . 
i left the best for the last , the west . 
i ask the government members to listen for a moment . 
where is the acknowledgement and the recognition of the new west and what it brings to Canada ' s 21 st century ? 
there is a new influence for good , for prosperity and for unity emerging in this country . 
it is an influence whose strength and vitality in the 21 st century is like that of Atlantic Canada in the 19 th century and Quebec and Ontario in the 20 th century . 
it is the growing influence of the new west , that portion of our country that stretches from western Ontario across the vast prairies and woodlands of Manitoba and Saskatchewan , into the plains and foothills of Alberta , across the mighty Rockies to the Pacific coast of the great province of British Columbia . 
the new west is built on the principle of freedom of enterprise , fiscal responsibility , compassion for the young , the old , the sick and the poor , equality of citizens and provinces and democracy that reflects the common sense of the common people . 
the new west is exercising new muscles and energy , not simply to get its old grievances addressed , but by offering a new source of hope and energy to unify our country and strengthen our economy . 
reform is the principal spokesperson for the new west in the federal Parliament . 
those who think that Reform is simply a protest party or that the new political energy in the west is simply protest are 15 years behind the times . 
the west can take care of its own regional grievances . 
the west believes that it can compete with the Americans and beat them two times out of three if it is on a level playing field . 
it demonstrates it every day . 
it is an example that can be multiplied in other parts of country . 
the west is ready to bring those ideas and energies to the national scene , not simply to advance its interests , not to protect its interests , but to make a contribution to the new Canada . 
this throne speech fails to speak to that spirit in the west . 
it fails to try to harness that substance to the national interest and thus misses a golden opportunity at the end of the 20 th century to harness energy and vigour to the task of uniting our country and making our economy strong . 
i conclude by commenting on the the dry bones throne speech once again . 
perhaps some would say that dry bones are enough . 
i do not believe the government is up to that challenge but prove me wrong if I am wrong . 
the challenge to other members of this House , and I do not just say Reform members , I say the challenge to other members in this House , including some of the government backbenchers who know that what I am saying is true , our challenge is that what realities the government has failed to recognize , let us recognize . 
what values the government has failed to represent , let us represent . 
what policies the government has failed to develop , let us propose . 
what hope the government has failed to give , let us inspire so that the 21 st century does in truth belong to Canada . 
to sum up , I move : 
that the following words be added to the address : " and this House regrets that your government is proposing a legislative program that is mired in the past , out of touch with the present , and incapable of leading Canadians with foresight and vigour into the 21 st century '' . 
the Speaker : 
this is an opposition amendment to the speech from the throne moved by the Leader of the Opposition . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this week we begin the last Parliament of this century and the first of the new millennium . 
i congratulate you on your election and express to you my high regard for your office . 
you bring decorum and dignity to this House and represent its great traditions and the historic responsibilities of your office . 
among those responsibilities which you discharge so will , is turning off the microphones when they are meant to be off . 
i can assure you that both my party and I will support you fully in this task and the other important functions of your office . 
i also want to congratulate the hon. member from Parkdale - High Park for her eloquent speech as mover of the address in reply to the speech from the trone , and the hon. member from Beauce for his speech as seconder . 
i am very proud of their maiden speeches and I must say their careers are definitely off to a good start . 
i can tell both members have great futures ahead of them in this House . 
since I last spoke in the House , we have had a general election . 
this is the 11 th time I have been elected to Parliament . 
the voters of Saint - Maurice have supported me for the tenth time and their confidence in me inspires me in my public life . 
they have taught me that politics is about people . 
what I ' ve learned on the sidewalks of Shawinigan , at the kitchen tables of rural farmhouses , and with workers on factory floors enriches all I do here as a member of Parliament and Prime Minister . 
the people of Saint - Maurice want a government that listens to them and respects them , and that is the kind of government I want to lead . 
parliament opens appropriately as another glorious Canadian summer comes to its end . 
our farmers reap their harvest and the young return to school . 
this fall , Canadians , especially young Canadians , begin to reap the rewards of what we have done together in the past four years . 
when I stood before you in January 1994 , many forecasted bleak economic harvests in our future . 
in reply to the speech from the throne I said then that everything that we would do would be " aimed at rebuilding our economic vitality to ensure that every Canadian is able to realize his or her potential '' . 
now we can say that we needed no polls to tell us that most Canadians did not think that we could ever gain control of the massive deficit that had deeply wounded the economy and Canadian self - confidence . 
who then would have believed that Canada would create 974,000 jobs between October 1993 and September 1997 ? 
who then would have predicted that our interest rates would fall far below those of the United States , in fact three and three - quarter per cent for the prime rate ? 
who then would have believed that we would have inflation lower than 2 per cent , growth close to 4 per cent and the highest rate of job creation in the G - 7 ? 
who then would have believed that four years later all the international forecasters would be predicting that Canada will enter the next millennium with the best economic performance of the G - 7 countries ? 
who then would have believed that I would be joining Canada ' s premiers in a spirit of co - operation in the fall of 1997 to discuss how we could help our youth , how we could improve our health system , how we could strengthen our social programs in an era of balanced budgets ? 
by working together , by being bold , by conquering fear and despair , Canadians have done much for themselves and for others . 
we have rebuilt economic vitality . 
indeed last week the Governor of the Bank of Canada said , " Canada is in better shape now than it has been for many years to face the economic challenges of the future '' . 
he said , " The Canadian economy has the potential for a long period of sustained growth in output and employment , with rising productivity and improving living standards '' . 
we made our priorities clear in the election campaign and in the speech from the throne . 
we will invest in children , our most precious resource . 
we will invest in knowledge to prepare Canada ' s youth for the technologies and knowledge based society of the future . 
we will work closely with the provinces to strengthen our health system following the excellent suggestions of the National Forum on Health . 
as a nation we invested in medicare exactly 30 years ago . 
i was in the House when we did that . 
what incredible dividends it has paid to Canadians , to our economy and even to our sense of identity . 
by strengthening and modernizing medicare to meet new needs , our health care system in the 21 st century will yield even greater returns . 
i would like with your permission , Mr. Speaker , to salute the Minister of Finance who introduced medicare , Mr. Sharp , who is in the gallery . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien : 
Mr. Speaker , at the beginning of the election campaign we said that we would spend some of our fiscal dividend on health care . 
we will be introducing legislation to increase health care transfers to the provinces in accordance with the recommendation of the National Forum on Health that the cash floor be $ 12.5 billion . 
this means that in 1998 - 99 the provinces will receive $ 700 million more than is currently budgeted . 
in 1999 - 2000 the provinces will receive $ 1.4 billion more than is currently budgeted . 
canada will remain the best country in which to live because it cares about its people . 
these are words that we did not hear in the speech from the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon . 
we will work very hard to continue to strengthen the economy , to continue to create a climate for more jobs and for sustained economic growth . 
i want to pay tribute today to the Minister of Finance for his remarkable achievement in managing the finances of the nation . 
i want to tell the House that we will never again allow the finances of the country to get out of control . 
we have already begun to reduce the debt as a proportion of the size of the economy . 
by 1998 - 99 the government will balance the budget for the first time in almost 30 years . 
working together with members of Parliament , with the provinces and , above all , with Canadians , we have removed the burden on our future that the deficit represented . 
no longer will we pass on present problems to future generations of Canadians . 
no longer will critics say that Canadian federalism does not work . 
there is a new optimism in Canada . 
Canadians have begun to dream again , and this Parliament ' s challenge is to live up to the spirit of those dreams . 
now we must move forward together into a new millennium . 
many in the House today are having their first taste of Parliament . 
from my long experience I can say that the taste will be enormously satisfying , of course spicy at times but in the end satisfying . 
some denigrate what Parliament can do but they are wrong . 
the situation today is much better than when I became a member of Parliament . 
even as a private member I was able to pass an important private member ' s bill changing the name of Trans - Canada airline . 
i worked with colleagues on both sides of the House . 
i asked some of them to shut up and to help , and we made that change . 
my success was shared with members on both sides of the House . 
let me tell you what we can do together as Canadians and parliamentarians . 
when I first entered Parliament , Canada faced a major crisis of poverty among seniors . 
despite general prosperity , many seniors found themselves victims of inflation and of the fact they had not been able to save much during the hard years of depression and war . 
the challenge was great , and the responsibility for dealing with it was shared . 
the federal government had an old age pension scheme , but , of course , the provinces had principal responsibilities in health , welfare and housing . 
the government of Canada worked with the provinces and through Parliament used the flexibility and creativity of our federal system to confront seniors ' poverty . 
Saskatchewan led in medicare ; Quebec worked effectively on pensions ; and Ontario and New Brunswick were innovative in housing . 
but it was the Government of Canada that gave national leadership to assure that the creativity of our individual provinces was shared by all Canadians . 
today the rate of seniors ' poverty in Canada is less than one - third of what it was only a generation ago . 
when the UN names Canada as the best country in the world to live in , it is partly because our seniors now live much longer lives , and are more comfortable financially . 
and in this mandate my government will assure seniors ' security for the future . 
they are our children and our grandchildren , and they will judge our generation by how well we have prepared theirs for the 21 st century . 
election campaigns are exciting for me , as for all of us , because we get a real chance to meet Canadians of every kind . 
my wife tells me that my excitement is greatest when I am around young people . 
the hopes and the dreams of the young are an inspiration for me , but in recent campaigns I heard too many fears mixed with their dreams . 
let me say frankly that we have lots of work to do . 
with the fiscal crisis at an end , our government has more ability to act . 
as the Minister of Finance said in his last budget , " a government relieved of its deficit burden is not a government relieved of its obligations . 
it is a government able to exercise its obligations '' . 
we owe our greatest obligation to our young , the future of Canada . 
as I think of the hopeful yet troubled eyes of the young people I met this summer , I become even more determined that our government will not evade its own responsibilities and opportunities . 
i know , as all of us do , that poverty is an enemy of a good start whether in aboriginal communities or in the urban centres of Vancouver , Toronto , Montreal and Halifax . 
parental love , family support and strong communities are antidotes to poverty ' s sting but they are not enough . 
people also need our help . 
by investing now in the well - being of today ' s children we are improving the long term social and economic health of our society . 
together federal and provincial governments must respond through the national child benefit system we are now building . 
during the course of this Parliament we pledge to do more to meet the needs of low income families with children . 
we will do so by increasing the child tax benefit and we will work in co - operation with the provinces as they invest in services for children . 
we have the best educated young Canadians in history . 
young Canadians can go to the best schools in the world , but too many drop out and too many do not find work . 
youth unemployment is simply too high . 
we will discuss this and more at the first ministers meeting this fall . 
we will step up our efforts at offering first jobs through internships and summer placements . 
we will challenge the private sector to train young Canadians to take leadership roles in the new knowledge based society of the future . 
we will develop with the provinces a mentorship program , and we will partner with the provinces and communities to give the young at risk a better chance at acquiring the skills and experience they need . 
the more education young people have , the better are their chances to find a job . 
we will challenge parents , communities , schools and provincial governments to encourage young people to stay in school . 
in my family every spare penny my parents could save went to education . 
for my parents the grass was greener on the other side of the fence and education was the way their children could get into greener fields . 
even though I was a bit of a trouble maker at school - and I have kept a bit of it - my parents never lost their dream for me and my better behaved brothers and sisters . 
their faith and devotion to our education put the spring in our leap that carried us over to the other side of the fence . 
today , together , parents , communities and governments must assure the barriers are not so high that young Canadians do not make it to the other side of the fence . 
the struggle against the deficit was not undertaken so that we could celebrate our accounting accomplishments . 
that is what we are going to do . 
we on this side of the House , plus two or three on the other side , do not believe that the role of government should be that of the 19 th century laissez - faire state waiting to deal with emergencies . 
rather we believe government in the 21 st century is an efficient , effective partner to make wise and strategic investments in areas that really count for the future prosperity of our country . 
one of the most important of these areas is knowledge and learning . 
it is the key to growth and jobs in years ahead . 
that is why , in the last budget , we announced the creation of a Canadian Foundation for Innovation . 
with the dividends from successful fiscal management , we made a one - time investment of $ 800 million designed to rebuild the research infrastructure of our universities and teaching hospitals . 
while I do not want to scoop the fiscal update of the Minister of Finance which will be delivered in mid - October , it is no secret that because of the good work of the government and of the Minister of Finance , we are doing a great deal better in 1997 - 98 than had originally been projected . 
i expect , therefore , that in the weeks after the Minister of Finance tables his fiscal update to be able to take advantage of another dividend from our successful fiscal management , to announce the deal of another one - time investment in learning and knowledge similar to what we did last year when we created the Canadian Foundation for Innovation but on a bigger scale . 
this time the purpose of the investment in our future will be to reduce barriers to access post - secondary education . 
there can be no greater millennium project for Canada and no better role for government than to help young Canadians prepare for the knowledge based society of the next century . 
as our most significant millennium project we will establish at arm ' s length from government a Canada millennium scholarship endowment fund . 
the income from the fund will reward academic excellence and will provide thousands of scholarships each year , beginning in the year 2000 for low and moderate income Canadians to help them attend universities and colleges . 
we will be working closely with appropriate partners to help in the actual design of the fund . 
it will not be a monument made of bricks and mortar but when future Canadians look around , they will see its legacy everywhere . 
i hope it can do in the 21 st century for our economy and our country what the investment after World War II in post - secondary education did for our returning soldiers , for our economy and our country in the last half of the 20 th century . 
on a very personal basis I hope it will be able to do in a different area for many thousands of young Canadians what my parents were able to do for me , my brothers and my sisters . 
in addition to this one - time endowment , the government will make further changes to the Canada Student Loans Programme and will increase assistance for students with dependents . 
with these and other measures , to be developed over the next few months in concert with the provinces , we will build on the progress made in the last budget to address the increasing cost of post - secondary education and the resulting debt burden on students . 
when I was young , pursuing my education meant that I had to leave home for boarding school . 
bill Gates has said that SchoolNet is " the leading programme in the world in terms of letting kids get out and use computers '' . 
and we know that we can , and must , do even more . 
as I travelled through Canada during the last four years , I saw how new technologies are strengthening rural Canada . 
we promised in our election programme that we would help rural Canada share new technologies and we will keep that promise . 
it is tremendously important to know that our great country with its millions of square kilometres will be the most connected country in the world by the millennium . 
distances will matter much less ; and we will see tha differrences need not divide . 
the promise of technology is astonishing but technology must have a soul . 
it was very troubled to read a survey this summer that suggested that young Canadians knew too little about each other and what we have done together . 
according to the survey , in every province except Quebec , more Canadians thought Neil Armstrong was the first Canadian in space rather than Marc Garneau . 
only 28 per cent of Quebec youth could name John A . Macdonald as our first prime minister , although 78 per cent of them could name Wilfrid Laurier as the first Francophone prime minister . 
too often we forget , or do not know , what we have achieved together . 
it is unacceptable that our youth may know all about computers but so little about their country . 
at one level , this is why our future youth programs will emphasize exchanges . 
i never knew Canada until I sat at kitchen tables in Saskatchewan , skiied in the Rockies , walked on the tundra in the Arctic , played pool on Fogo Island in Newfoundland , and talked with aboriginal elders around fires . 
similarly , Canada touches my heart and affects my thoughts as I discover the grandeur of our history . 
it moves me deeply to learn that over 150 years ago , when religion and race caused wars everywhere else in the world , here in Canada Robert Baldwin resigned his seat in the Parliament of the United Canada ' s so that his colleague , Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine , could run in a seat in the heart of English Canada . 
Lafontaine became the francophone Catholic member for a thoroughly English and Protestant riding . 
working together , Baldwin and Lafontaine brought us responsible government . 
how many young Canadians know that just over a century ago as religious quarrels engulfed the world , Canada , a country with a large Protestant and British majority , elected its first francophone Catholic Prime Minister ? 
it had the good sense to re - elect Laurier for three more terms , a reasonable goal for any prime minister , it seems to me . 
we must find ways for young Canadians to learn what they share , to know what we have done and to gain pride in their nation ' s accomplishments . 
the Government of Canada will work with our great museums , other federal and provincial institutions and with voluntary groups to develop ways to increase Canadians ' knowledge of what we have done together . 
we Canadians have built together an astonishing country , respected , even envied throughout the world . 
this fall more than 100 nations will come to Ottawa to sign a treaty banning forever the use of anti - personnel landmines . 
the foreign minister deserves our congratulations for a job well done . 
we worked with others of like mind and showed that Canada can make a real difference in the world . 
at one of the international meetings I recently attended , a world leader told me that only Canada could have been the leader in the campaign against landmines . 
i most strongly agree with the recent comment of the opposition member for Esquimalt - Saanich , a medical doctor who has seen landmines tear apart human bodies and who has worked with us to achieve the ban . 
he told reporters that the landmine treaty marks the " the onset of a new era in Canadian foreign policy using our moral force for humanitarian purposes . 
this treaty , " he said , " will save tens of thousands of lives '' . 
that moral force comes from what we are , what we have done together and what values we share in common . 
Canadians expressed that spirit nationally during the Saguenay and Manitoba floods . 
as we stood at the dikes and watched the raging waters we shared the experience as Canadians . 
my government feels the burden of that moral force in all that we do . 
that is why we will take a very broad approach to promoting and strengthening our unity . 
when we seek to realize the highest aspiration of Canadians we help make Canada more united . 
i welcome the Calgary initiative of the premiers and territorial leaders . 
it is a positive and constructive statement and affirmation of important values about what Canada is , and what makes us Canadian . 
the French fact is an essential part of my identity , one that has nurtured me , one that has given me strength and identity , one that has made me the Canadian I am . 
the message to Quebecers , to all French - speaking Canadians , indeed to all Canadians , is one of openness and solidarity . 
it is a message that should be heard . 
i welcome the very constructive approach that the leaders of the Reform Party , the New Democratic Party and the Conservative Party are taking on this issue . 
i urge Quebecers to hear the message coming from Calgary and to join in building on it . 
the words form Calgary should be taken form what they are , an inclusive and timely message for all to hear . 
it is an important step in building understanding and confidence . 
nothing more should be read into it . 
since this is not a constitutional or legal text , I would urge Canadians not to be drawn into a legalistic analysis of a statement of values . 
the day may come - I hope it will , and it will if Quebec ever has a government willing to work for those Quebecers who wish to remain a part of Canada , and they are the majority - when there is a legal and constitutional text to consider as such . 
the words from Calgary are an attempt to express worthy Canadian values and that is how they should be welcomed . 
i pledge to all Canadians that we are open to all good ideas to strengthen the unity of our country . 
we invite the ideas of all opposition parties , and we will have an opportunity to discuss them either in this House or in committee . 
but we will never be hostage to demands that diminish or deny to each and every Canadian the benefits of his or her citizenship and our nationhood , our existence as an independent nation recognized by the UN . 
we will continue to be frank and open about the consequences of what those who seek to partition Canada are proposing . 
our adversary is confusion . 
i am convinced that when things are clear , Quebecers and other Canadians will choose to stay together because it is the best choice for them and their children . 
as I have emphasized today , we are committed to collaboration and partnership with all those who , in good faith , will work with us to realize the wonderful opportunities that await Canada and Canadians . 
our strength , our character and our recent successes have positioned us to pursue those opportunities in new ways to meet new challenges of a new century . 
Alberta and Saskatchewan were not yet provinces . 
the slums of Montreal and Halifax had a high rate of infant mortality than do the modern slums of Calcutta where Mother Teresa toiled . 
few Canadians even met others more than 50 miles away . 
on the prairies new settlers lived in isolation throughout cold winters , unaware of the petroleum riches beneath them . 
and yet we knew we had a future . 
at the beginning of the century Laurier dreamed of that future when he said : 
three years ago when in England , I visited one of those models of Gothic architecture - The cathedral was made of granite , oak and marble . 
it is the image of the nation I wish to become . 
out of these elements I would build a nation great among the nations of the world . 
we have built that nation and we continue to shape its elements . 
our young will do so in the next century . 
their architecture will be new but it will be Canadian . 
greatness may have a different meaning but it will be Canadian . 
today there is in Canada once again a wonderful sense of a country moving , of a country that matters , of a country that dreams again . 
for a long time for too many Canadians Canada has seemed stuck . 
now everywhere Canadians together are making choices for a new millennium . 
i pledge to Canadians that this Parliament and this government will be worthy of their dreams and their aspirations . 
with every ounce of energy we have , with the support of our colleagues and our fellow Canadians , we will keep this wonderful country , this Canada , our Canada , united . 
together we will move into the next millennium as a prosperous , tolerant , generous , caring and modern country . 
this country will be a model to the world . 
we are all very privileged to be members of this Parliament . 
people see Canada as the country to look at . 
when we travel around the world we realize that we are the envy of the world . 
millions and millions of human beings around the world would give their last penny to share this citizenship of ours . 
that is why we have the collective duty to work together to make this country even greater and to give the best country in the world to our children and our grandchildren . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
after the last election , we find ourselves in a fragmented Parliament , a Parliament reflecting the true face of Canada . 
the Bloc Quebecois finds itself as the principal Quebec party , the main voice for Quebec in Ottawa . 
forty - four members , constituting the majority of the Quebec deputation , 60 percent of the deputation in fact , that is what the Bloc Quebecois represents . 
a second conclusion must also be reached : after going after the deficit at the expense of the unemployed and the most disadvantaged members of society , by hacking savagely at transfer payments to the provinces for health and education and at unemployment insurance , now this government has the gall , the indecency , to make use of the surpluses generated by its own cutbacks to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction . 
clearly , the aim is political visibility rather than efficiency for the public . 
with this objective , this second conclusion falls in line with our first one . 
the cuts to unemployment insurance , the cuts to social assistance imposed on the provinces and the reductions in health and education transfers occasioned by this government ' s deficit reduction have wreaked havoc in the lives of thousands of Canadians . 
if I had to summarize the speech on government policy , I would say that the word is federalism in capital letters . 
in its speech , the government is inviting us to take part in a great debate on the post zero deficit age . 
the Liberals are proposing that half the surplus go to paying the debt and to reducing taxes . 
the other half would go to misusing its spending power in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction . 
having been the cause of many social ills , the government now wants to set itself up as the saviour . 
it will have cut $ 42 billion from social programs , health care , education and social assistance , thus forcing the closure of hospitals , driving thousands of workers denied unemployment insurance toward welfare and causing massive cuts in schools . 
the surpluses that will be generated after the deficit is eliminated should not be used for federalist propaganda , but should go directly to reinstating the transfer payments made to the provinces for social programs . 
specifically , this would mean more money for hospitals and CLSCs . 
it would also mean more teachers and student services . 
secondly , surpluses should go to job creation through a targeted reduction in payroll taxes . 
in its electoral platform , the Bloc proposed that the employment insurance fund surplus be used to lower employment insurance premiums by at least 35 « and to re - invest $ 2.5 billion in improving assistance to the unemployed , including the seasonally unemployed . 
not returning the annual surplus of approximately $ 7 billion in the employment insurance fund , and not telling workers and the unemployed about this surplus , is a clear misappropriation of funds . 
the suggestions I am now making had the agreement of the premiers in St. Andrews recently . 
next , the surpluses must be used in the fight against poverty . 
and this includes improving the employment insurance system , given the deep cuts made over the last five years , particularly in benefits to seasonal workers . 
finally , there is the long overdue $ 2 billion in compensation paid to the Maritimes but not to Quebec for harmonizing the GST , one of the demands from Quebec that was also supported by all premiers at the St. Andrews meeting . 
and only after it has fulfilled these obligations should the federal government think about lowering taxes or reducing the debt . 
but instead of repairing the damage caused by its policies , the government announces that it will now use this breathing room to systematically interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction . 
the worst interference ever seen in the history of Canada . 
even Pierre Elliott Trudeau never dared to go this far . 
and that ' s saying something . 
the government is confirming its interference in the health field by creating a pharmacare plan , when Quebec already has its own such plan . 
moreover , after taking over 30 years to partially withdraw from the manpower training sector , this same federal government is now seeking , six months later , to maintain , confirm and increase its involvement in youth training . 
one the very few new things mentioned in this speech is that the federal government will now get directly involved in education , in order to , and I quote : " measure the readiness of Canadian children to learn '' , through an innocuous leaflet sent to every home . 
and then are we going to have national standards in the education sector ? 
are we going to have national exams in that sector ? 
i say we will never let the federal government get involved in Quebec ' s schools . 
never . 
the prevailing ideology in the rest of Canada is getting further than ever from Quebec ' s traditional demands and aspirations . 
such hardening is being promoted in an irresponsible fashion by the comments of the Reform Party , by the actions of the Liberal Party of Canada , and by the collusive silence of the leader of the Conservative Party . 
as for the NDP , it has always ignored the Quebec issue , and in fact this is why Quebecers have always ignored the NDP . 
slowly but surely , through the use of psychological profiles , changing democratic rules , hate - filled Internet sites and the promotion of partition , public opinion in the rest of Canada is falling into collective beliefs that still smack of colonialism as regards Quebec , in that they view us merely as a quaint entity . 
this attitude is obvious in the government ' s throne speech . 
never before , in a Speech from the Throne , has a government so directly threatened Quebec ' s right to decide on its own future . 
moreover , the Liberal government is dropping the solemn commitment made after the referendum to recognize Quebec as a distinct society , after putting it in a motion passed by the House of Commons , and after repeating it in the form of an election promise in its second red book . 
further watering down recognition of the Quebec people , this government has embraced the definition in the Calgary declaration , referring to the " unique character of Quebec society '' , as unique as B.C. salmon , and without constitutional amendments . 
if we carefully examine this agreement , it is easy to understand why the Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs were so enthusiastic . 
this is the worst it has ever been for Quebec . Several experts agree it is far less than Meech and even less than Charlottetown . 
the federalists were rather quick to applaud the results of a recent survey on this agreement . 
they should not get carried away , because as Quebecers become better acquainted with the contents of this agreement , their support will be affected accordingly . 
in the rest of Canada , we already hear people saying that Quebec has been given too much . 
there is a very real possibility it will be Charlottetown all over again . 
the only message sent to Quebec in this throne speech is that we should be satisfied with Canada as served up in Calgary , otherwise it will be Plan B . 
that is Canada ' s bilingual character . 
i have only a few words for the rest of Canada about the premiers meeting which was held in Calgary . 
the Bloc Quebecois has never deviated from its basic principles . 
now more than ever , we deem sovereignty to be necessary . 
the constitutional impasse is still there , even more so since the Calgary declaration . 
the main purpose of the Bloc Quebecois is clear : to advance the sovereignist project while staunchly defending Quebec ' s interests . 
during this next mandate , defending Quebec ' s interests will have to involve defending Quebec ' s democratic institutions . 
when we came to Ottawa , we knew it would be hard , that harsh words would be exchanged . 
yet we would never have dreamed that we would have to defend democracy , we would never have dreamed that the federal government would stoop so low as to question the very foundations of democracy . 
this best country in the world is behaving like an imperial power looking down its nose at its ignorant colony , which dared to get just a little too uppity on the evening of October 30 , 1995 . 
yet the rules governing the last two referendums were accepted by all parties , including the federal government . 
a federal government which , let us recall , accepted Newfoundland into Confederation with a close vote in a second referendum . 
casting doubt on those rules now indicates obvious bad faith and , in particular , a profound disdain for the near - victory of the yes side in the last referendum . 
let us look a little closer at the rules the Prime Minister is trying to discredit with the help of his hatchet man , the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
in Quebec , all of the province ' s political leaders agree on the rules governing Quebec ' s move to sovereignty . 
there is clearly a consensus in Quebec on this , which the federal government is refusing to recognize . 
this consensus is grounded on three basic principles : first , the existence of the people of Quebec ; next , respect for fundamental democratic principles ; finally , the integrity of Quebec territory . 
all of Quebec ' s premiers , be they federalist or sovereignist , from Daniel Johnson senior to Robert Bourassa , have defended these three principles . 
the federalists , in their post - referendum panic and without an argument to stand on , are going after the process , trying to discredit it by all possible means . 
by doing so , however , they are the ones discrediting democracy in Canada by deriding the rules underlying it . 
partition , a reference to the Supreme Court , doubt cast on the rule of the simple majority , a country wide referendum , all threats and fears are fair game . 
under the tutelage of the Reform Party , the Liberal Party of Canada has chosen not to face the issue . 
everything is being questioned with the almost acknowledged aim of frightening Quebecers and with the obvious aim of saying , " You will never do it '' . 
the bidding is escalating at the expense of Quebecers . 
although they are not acceptable , these attacks against Quebec ' s democratic institutions are not the real problem . 
although they are irresponsible and dangerous , the threats of the partition and hacking - up of Quebec are not the real problem . 
although it is both absurd and disgusting , the reference to the Supreme Court aimed at depriving Quebecers of their right to decide their future democratically is not the real problem . 
this is the root cause of the deadlock . 
the Liberal Party of Canada ' s approach has failed , because it denies the existence of the people of Quebec people , a people different from the people of Canada . 
by so doing , the big guns in the federalist camp are endorsing the position of the leader of the official opposition , who stubbornly denies the existence of the people of Quebec as one of the two founding nations of Canada in 1867 . 
Canadians are a people . 
the aboriginal peoples are made up of several peoples . 
people all over the world are divided into various peoples . 
if it is good for everybody else , why would it be bad for Quebecers ? 
i appeal specifically to members from Quebec in this House who , over and above their mandate , are citizens who must believe in respecting democracy and above all in the existence of the people of Quebec . 
we urge you not to be part of the government ' s blind denial of the facts when it refuses to recognize that the people of Quebec people exists and is free to decide its own future . 
to conclude , let me say a word or two about Canada ' s future . 
in its Speech from the Throne , the government is predicting a brilliant future for Canada during the third millennium . 
it even invites us to celebrate this future success ahead of time . 
we see things differently . 
we believe that Canada is at a crossroad . 
then , the government will give Quebec the right to decide its own future in accordance with the democratic rules which are part of the common heritage of the peoples of Canada and Quebec . 
thus , it will become once again a model at the international level , with which a sovereign Quebec will be able to build a real partnership . 
not a pseudo - partnership where Quebec would simply carry out orders from Ottawa , but a fruitful partnership between two sovereign countries . 
this is simply reasonable , this is plain common sense . 
or the government can let itself go and drift away from democracy , this has already started , driven mostly by the anti - sovereignist phobia of the Prime Minister and his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
and this is the open door to all excesses , a slide towards anger and intolerance , towards totally anti - democratic behaviour . 
this is a dead end street . 
unfortunately , it is this second alternative which seems to prevail at the present time , because of a Prime Minister who is blinded and intoxicated by the arabesques and arrogance of his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
this is regrettable , but I am deeply convinced that in the end the Canadian people , whom I sincerely trust , will not allow it . 
the government will have to pay a heavy price for having defiled its own institutions . 
members of the Bloc Quebecois will continue to stand by the democratic traditions of Lester B . Pearson ' s Canada . 
we will continue to respect this House despite the fact that many members on the government side try to defile it and use it for their own anti - sovereignist obsessions , as they are presently trying to do with the Supreme Court . 
in concluding , I move : 
that the amendment be modified by adding after the words " legislative program " the following : 
" that denies the existence of the Qu é b é cois people and their culture , which once again reflects the government ' s centralizing vision by confirming and increasing its presence in areas of provincial jurisdiction such as social programs , health and especially education , and '' . 
the Speaker : 
the amendment is in order . 
we now have a few minutes for questions and comments . 
if there are questions and comments , I will allow them ; if not , we will move on . 
as there are no questions or comments , I give the floor to the leader of the New Democratic Party , the hon. member for Halifax . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I rise in my place in this Chamber for the very first time I wish to congratulate you , Sir , on your re - election to continue serving as Speaker among your 300 peers . 
it is an honour for sure but also a daunting task . 
i also want to congratulate and thank the other candidates to the Chair . 
i know , Mr. Speaker , that it is your job to create a respectful political climate and at the same time favourable working conditions for all members who are elected to serve the public interest in this great Parliament of Canada . 
i also know that it is the responsibility of the Speaker to attend to the working conditions for all of the employees who serve Parliament here on Parliament Hill and in the precincts in the surrounding area . 
i must say that over the last year and a half as I have served as leader of the New Democratic Party without a seat in Parliament I have looked on with some frustration and some horror as I have watched the deteriorating conditions for some of the people who are serving us here on Parliament Hill . 
in particular , I have felt a great deal of consternation at the spectacle of hundreds of locked out security guards . 
Mr. Speaker , I know that it is not because you failed to exercise your duties but rather the government has been willing to not only tolerate but actually sponsor first the training and then the hiring of replacement workers who have replaced workers earning barely above minimum wage and who are coming up to a one year anniversary of the time when they were locked out from their jobs here on Parliament Hill . 
i hope it is a sign of better times to come that there is some indication those security guards are now looking at a tentative agreement . 
i hope that as we come up to the one year anniversary of that lockout we will instead be celebrating a just settlement on behalf of those workers and their families . 
i am delighted today to finally be taking my seat in the House of Commons and I am delighted to be surrounded by some 20 New Democrat colleagues . 
it is certainly true that three quarters of the NDP caucus are rookies , I among them , at least newcomers to this Chamber . 
Mr. Speaker , for that reason we will be looking to you frequently for guidance and counsel . 
i hope we can expect a little patience as we learn the rules and the procedures of the House . 
i am sad that Stanley Knowles did not live to see this day , that he did not live to see the official return to the House of Commons of the party which he helped to found . 
it is a bittersweet celebration for us today . 
many of us learned of Stanley ' s death as we were arriving in Ottawa for our first caucus meeting in June . 
we will all miss Stanley Knowles greatly , his warmth , his humour , his fierce unyielding dedication to justice and equality and his unparalleled expertise in the rules and procedures that govern Parliament . 
we all remember Stanley ' s lifelong battle for decent pensions for working people . 
Stanley would never have been fooled by euphemisms like seniors benefits into believing that a massive reduction in pension benefits was an improvement . 
we pledge today to honour Stanley ' s memory by fighting any further erosion of pension protection for our seniors . 
on this occasion I give thanks for the tremendous contribution that Stanley Knowles made to the House of Commons , to my party and to the people of Canada . 
on the day of Stanley Knowles ' funeral , a close long time friend of his arrived at my office . 
he brought me two publications that were co - authored by Stanley and by my father who came to work in Ottawa as the first researcher for the CCF caucus in the early 1940 s . 
those publications talked about a more democratic Canada . 
for me it is a humbling experience and I admit an emotional occasion to take my place in the House of Commons , to continue that struggle for a more democratic and a more social democratic Canada . 
i was born in Ottawa because of my parents ' decision to come here and be part of that social democratic movement . 
but of course Halifax is where I have spent most of my life and Halifax is the riding I have the privilege to represent here in the Parliament of Canada . 
let me take a moment or two to tell the House a bit about my riding of Halifax . 
Halifax is often said to be something of a bell - wether riding . 
i must say I never really quite believed that until the June 2 election . 
but when all four Halifax area federal ridings elected New Democrats to represent them in this session of Parliament , I knew that Halifax was a bell - wether riding . 
Halifax is a growing modern metropolis and yet it is still characterized by the generosity and the openness of a small farming town or a fishing outport . 
our maritime traditions are well known ; the courage of our military men and women serving overseas , the resourcefulness of our current armed forces and civilian personnel rising to new challenges . 
less well known perhaps is our rich cultural ethnic diversity in Halifax and Nova Scotia generally . 
that diversity I am pleased to say is very much reflected in the caucus that I have the privilege to lead in this Parliament . 
it includes , for instance , the first Acadians in a New Democratic caucus as well as an aboriginal member from the Prairies . 
we have the first Afro - Canadian member of Parliament elected from Atlantic Canada , several members from recent immigrant families and , I would add , the most women ever elected to the New Democrat caucus . 
my predecessor , the member for Yukon , served in the House with dignity and devotion under much more difficult circumstances , outnumbered by her caucus colleagues eight to one . 
i guess it can be said that the only caucus that has ever come close to being gender balanced in Parliament is the past Conservative caucus . 
i do not know anybody who is recommending that formula for gender balance . 
permit me to quote briefly a favourite passage : " There is nothing so congenial to lucid thought as a clear view of the sea . 
it airs the mind , tunes the nerves and scours the soul '' . 
maybe the inspiration of the ocean explains the eruption of self - discovery in Atlantic Canada these days . 
now this quiet Atlantic revolution is sending shock waves through the world of politics . 
my colleagues and I are well aware that we have an enormous responsibility , a mandate born out of suffering and out of hope . 
i want to say to my constituents and to all Canadians , Atlantic Canadians , today that we will not let them down in the coming Parliament . 
it is gratifying to see provincial and territorial leaders commit to the unity initiative announced earlier this month in Calgary , but let me also say that Canada is bigger than any constitution . 
far more crucial than any notion of equality among the provinces is the fundamental equality of Canadians , Canadians as citizens , equality before the law , equality of services , equality of opportunity . 
worsening our inequalities can only gladden the hearts of those who seek to divide us . 
in order to capture the hearts and minds of the people of Quebec , we must prove that Canada can work well once again , that Canada can once again become a country where economic security , sound communities , interesting opportunities and real human charity prevail . 
this Parliament must focus on rebuilding that kind of Canada . 
otherwise , the next Parliament may very well represent a much smaller and a much sadder Canada . 
if this government is willing to tackle the whole question of unity instead of focusing on the narrow agenda of those who would divide us then we will work with it for the shared goals of compassion , community and unity ; but that requires that this government do some serious rethinking and requires a new commitment to the real priorities of Canadians . 
women are the most vulnerable . 
it is no surprise that this government has abandoned women . 
the first 1993 red book promise broken was that of a national child care program . 
Canadian families and Canada ' s children are still waiting . 
let us look at how this government treats its own women employees . 
the government is still refusing to honour the $ 2 billion pay equity debt owing to 80,000 women in this country . 
aboriginal communities across the country are desperate for economic development and jobs while this government stalls on the royal commission recommendations . 
twenty - five per cent real youth unemployment is eating away at our country ' s future . 
Canadians have heard lots of lofty Liberal promises , but the fact is that there are 20,000 more youth unemployed today than this time last year . 
the program reannounced in yesterday ' s throne speech will not make a dent for the 410,000 unemployed youth . 
a whole generation of our young people finish their studies without being rewarded with a decent job offer and find themselves strapped with a huge debt , $ 25,000 on average . 
what is really happening with medicare ? 
who bears the brunt ? 
the short answer judging by yesterday ' s throne speech is nowhere . 
canada ' s most endangered species is a federal Liberal politician willing to take any responsibility to protect our natural environment . 
i want to be fair . 
there is one solid government achievement that we all celebrate . 
i want to give credit where it is due . 
canada has played a pivotal role in the resolve to eliminate global stocks of landmines . 
i trust the government will have the humility to acknowledge the work of so many Canadians whose pressure on our own government and others laid the foundation for this important success . 
i know all parliamentarians will join me in underlining the singular contribution made to Canada ' s effort by the late Diana , Princess of Wales . 
the treaty to be signed here in Ottawa will serve as a fitting tribute to her legacy and her memory . 
every Canadian can be proud of this achievement . 
i pledge today my party ' s support to further the goals of that treaty and rid the world of all inhumane weapons of war . 
the Speaker : 
i know the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party is just wrapping up . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
Mr. Speaker , I might ask unanimous consent to make my concluding comments . 
i appreciate and respect the time limits . 
these are the values of my party and they are the values that we will fight for in the coming Parliament , giving our children the best possible start in life , education and job opportunities for our young , decent pensions for our seniors , medicare for all and poverty for none , a healthy environment for future generations and strong safe thriving communities . 
my caucus invites this government to honour that spirit , to learn from it and to unleash it to build the country we all know Canada can be . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this reminds me of my first day of return to the House . 
i sat here and said to myself " I am surrounded , surrounded by Progressive Conservatives '' . 
what a contrast with the last legislature . 
we are very happy to be back in this legislature and in this Parliament and to find the voice we had lost in the last few years . 
i would also like to congratulate the leaders of the other parties who were re - elected in their ridings and who will have the opportunity to cross swords with all the members in this Parliament . 
i would also like to congratulate all those who were elected or re - elected , especially the new members who are here for the first time and who are about to experience something extraordinary . 
i would be remiss if I did not seize this opportunity to thank , from the bottom of my heart , the constituents of Sherbrooke , Fleurimont and Lennoxville who have re - elected me for the fourth time . 
i must tell you I owe these people a great deal . 
they are remarkable . 
i have had the privilege of representing them for many years now . 
i am trying - with some success , I believe - to give a true picture of what they are ; they in turn illustrate quite well what I represent . 
to those people I want to reiterate my sincerest thanks and I want to confirm that I intend to serve them with the utmost dedication and energy . 
an election campaign is a moment for the country to stop , to reflect , to look back and hopefully to look forward . 
the last election campaign was an opportunity to do that . 
for me and for my party the last three and a half or four years have been very much about learning more about Canada , about exploring our possibilities and about going forward . 
in the last two years and during the election campaign a number of things struck me about our country that are worth repeating today . 
beyond the walls of this Parliament , beyond partisanship , beyond the rhetoric , there are a lot of good things to speak about in this country . 
there always was , by the way . 
i want to take a second - and it may sound unusual to some members - to speak about our successes as a country in dealing with our deficits and debts . 
a very powerful consensus exists in Canada for governments to balance their books and get their priorities right . 
there is so much consensus that we find New Democrats in Saskatchewan , Liberals in the Atlantic provinces , the Parti qu é b è cois in Quebec City and even , who would have thought , the federal Liberal Party of Canada have come around to the idea that we have to actually balance our books . 
no matter how much they would like to redo history and say that everything was the fault of the previous government , that they had nothing to do with it , little do they mention , because their memory is selective , that they left behind when we came to government in 1984 a debt that had increased 1,000 per cent fold under the leadership of the Liberal government , including this Prime Minister . 
their memory is so selective . 
this is also a country that has done very well in the area of trade . 
thank God we had trade agreements . 
thank God we fought and won the election of 1988 and had the free trade agreement that allowed this country to increase merchandise export trade to the United States by 100 per cent . 
we fought and signed the North American free trade agreement . 
do they remember that the same people who now sit on the government benches fought us tooth and nail on the free trade agreement ? 
what do we have today ? 
we have a Prime Minister bent on travelling outside the country to increase trade with new countries . 
he is now bragging about his new amigos in Chile . 
he wants to sign deals with Argentina . 
he wants to sign deals with Israel . 
he cannot get enough of it . 
yet they fought us every inch of the way . 
the good news is that had it not been for these trade agreements that we signed , that we fought for , Canada would have had no growth in its economy . 
our domestic economy has been on its back for the last four years . 
you have to appreciate the spectacle of the Prime Minister and the Liberal benches rising during question period to applaud the government on its brilliant record . 
what is the record they are applauding ? 
there are more poor children today in Canada than there were when this government was elected . 
what is the record of the Liberal government that its members all applauded ? 
it is the record of a government that has left Canadians poorer today than they were in 1993 . 
maybe they should travel to Atlantic Canada . 
maybe they should stay out of the OECD a little more , move away from Paris and Sweden or the Norwegian countries . 
if they spent a little more time in Atlantic Canada and in western Canada they might find out why so few Canadians rise to applaud them when they speak of their record . 
this is also a country that saw its health care and social spending slashed unilaterally , without consultation . 
this was unprecedented : a 40 per cent cut in funding . 
was there any consultation ? 
by the way , where was all the talk of partnership back then , this great notion of rediscovered partnership ? 
during the election campaign the Liberals had to back down on health care because the health care system in this country is broken . 
the health care system in this country is suffering . 
the health care system in this country is threatened . 
it is threatened because of the actions of this government and this Prime Minister and failed leadership . 
they are going to be held accountable in this Parliament for having done that . 
the Speech from the Throne was the opportunity for the government to say to Canadians what it is about this new century , this new era that it cares about , that it wants to focus on . 
why did the Prime Minister go to the polls three years into the mandate ? 
we could have expected a Canadian agenda . 
what did we get instead ? 
the usual expressions of goodwill . 
how many times can we rediscover youth unemployment ? 
speech after speech , and budget after budget gives us these useless , meaningless words , backed up by absolutely nothing , except a measure announced a few days ago , $ 90 million for an internship program for 3,000 young Canadians . 
about half a million young Canadians are out of work . 
i think it is more than 400,000 . 
that is the great initiative of this Liberal government . 
we heard . " 
there were many messages sent in the campaign . 
one of them at least the Prime Minister and I would agree on . 
he certainly did not return with the majority that he was hoping for . 
he certainly did not return with the vast support from all of the regions of the country . 
if there is one thing the Prime Minister and the Liberal government must have understood , it is that they definitely did not get the mandate that they were hoping for and that they talked so much about at the beginning of the election campaign . 
so a message was sent to them . 
we wonder however if that message was understood . 
is there any indication in the throne speech that this government accepted and heeded the message sent by the Canadian people ? 
we were expecting a national action plan , a plan that would set priorities and tell us how we would enter the new millennium . 
what did we get instead ? 
we heard from a government that wants to repent , a government that tells us it will reinvest money in certain programs . 
in which programs will the government reinvest ? 
it will reinvest in culture , after making cuts in that sector . 
and it will reinvest in post - secondary education , after reducing its support . 
a few minutes ago , we witnessed something extraordinary . 
this was in 1995 . 
and do you know what happened , Mr. Speaker ? 
i see the member for Rimouski , who was there as well , and the leader of the Bloc Quebecois . 
they all rose as they did this afternoon and applauded the Minister of Finance . 
this afternoon , the Prime Minister announced a new scholarship program . 
guess what ? 
they all rose together and applauded again . 
that is what they did . 
but we did not applaud , because we were extremely sad to see such a good program being cancelled . 
what has changed in the meantime ? 
thousands of students have lost the financial support they needed to pursue their studies . 
why ? 
because the government was shortsighted and unable to sort out its own priorities . 
what has not changed is the docility of the Liberal backbenchers , who rise and applaud their Minister of Finance and their Prime Minister day after day . 
they will speak up for the people of the Atlantic provinces , since silence has reigned in recent years . 
this same government is now talking about reinvestments and partnerships . 
but if this government understands what true partnership means , what is it waiting for to form a partnership in the area of health , to co - manage our federation ? 
this government had an opportunity with health care to demonstrate that it really believed in partnership instead of acting unilaterally . 
there is still an opportunity . 
the government could still sit down with the provinces and agree to national standards in health care . 
nowhere is it written in the Constitution that it has to be decided by Ottawa and enforced by Ottawa . 
let me share a secret with the Prime Minister . 
his position on health care is untenable . 
he cannot cut the provinces by 35 per cent and then sit at the same table and say to them " I will run the show '' . 
it is not going to work . 
the worst news is that it is not the Prime Minister ' s government or the provincial governments that will suffer . 
we await the Prime Minister ' s partnership . 
we hope this time the words will be worth more than they were the last time they were spoken . 
the same is true for child poverty or youth policy . 
we spoke of a youth policy with a clear objective where every young person should either be in school , in training , at work or doing community service . 
the national government can do something useful in that regard . 
you , sir , have the power to change the employment insurance system as it applies to young people . 
you do not have to ask anyone ' s permission . 
all you have to do is work with the provinces - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order . 
i know the hon. member is an experienced member . 
hon. Jean J . Charest : 
i would be more than happy to address my remarks to the Chair , Mr. Speaker . 
as I was saying , the Prime Minister has an opportunity to do so . 
we hope he is sincere in his extending a hand for some advice . 
we should all recognize outright that education and training are provincial jurisdictions but the Prime Minister happens to have some control . 
in this Parliament control of EI is an important lever that has an impact on the decisions young people make in the area of education and training . 
the employment insurance system must be put at the service of the objectives we pursue in this area . 
the same is true in regard to the issues as they affect aboriginal Canadians . 
i was happy to see at least in the Speech from the Throne an acknowledgement of the royal commission ' s report . 
i am far from agreeing with everything that is in that report but we cannot as a country remain in denial in dealing with what is going to be one of the most important issues of the next century , an issue that will test our values . 
the most disappointing part is on jobs and on taxes . 
the government had an opportunity . 
this is a government that could have sent the signal that it has learned something about the last 30 years . 
but what has this Liberal government been saying to us now that we are facing the prospect of a surplus ? 
it is saying that there is new money , that the promised land has arrived , that happy days are back again . 
the Prime Minister and his government say that they are going to spend that money because they have learned nothing from the last 30 years . 
this government works on a few assumptions . 
the first assumption is that if there is a problem then the answer must be that government has to intervene . 
the second assumption is that if a government must intervene it has to be the federal government . " We ' re the ones who have to intervene , no one else '' . 
the third assumption is that if there is a problem we have to spend money . 
that is the Liberal philosophy . 
it is written nicely . 
i assume that it is written over the Prime Minister ' s door " If you send it we will spend it '' . 
that is the way it goes . 
let us talk to the real record of this government , the record the government was applauding this afternoon . 
the real country with which we compare is to the south of us . 
it is a quite imperfect comparison , but maybe the prime minister could explain to us why the unemployment rate in the United States is half what it is in Canada . 
if something goes wrong during the term of this government it is the fault of the past government . 
the government could have offered a different course to the country . 
with respect to taxes this government should not put up with the shameless rip off of employed Canadians , of the working poor in this country , who are being gouged because the government is using the employment insurance fund to pay down the deficit . 
i asked the question in the House today yes or no , is the employment insurance fund of the government being used to reduce the deficit . 
the government is paying down the deficit on the backs of workers , small businesses and on the backs of the unemployed , especially young unemployed Canadians . 
if the government wanted to do something today it could reduce premiums 25 per cent . 
are they listening ? 
no , they are heckling . 
maybe I am not convincing . 
maybe I am too partisan . 
but do members think that the Canadian Chambers of Commerce is too partisan ? 
do members think that le Conseil du patronat is too partisan ? 
i do not think so . 
i hope the government will learn . 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to ask that the hon. leader of the Conservative Party be afforded the same privilege which was afforded the leader of the New Democratic Party , that he be , by the unanimous consent of the House , permitted to finish his remarks . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent for the hon. member to complete his remarks ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
hon. Jean J . Charest : 
Mr. Speaker , the government speaks of taxes . 
it speaks of trade . 
there is all this talk of rebalancing the federation . 
a new balance of responsibilities will be established in the federation . 
and no need to say that the leader of the official opposition wants a massive decentralization . 
however , there are areas where the powers of the national government must be strengthened because it is not by stripping the federal government of all its responsibilities that we will keep the country united . 
if this government believes in the real rebalancing of the federation it would also speak to the areas where the national government should reinforce its powers . 
believe it or not , this party of mine , the party which founded the country , the party of Sir John A . Macdonald , the party which was here through good and bad times , also knows that a strong central government in the areas in which it should be strong is the best bet in keeping this country together . 
again I will offer some advice to my colleague . 
if the government really believed in the strength of leadership it would offer some leadership on interprovincial trade . 
the prime minister is going to do another Team Canada trip in January . 
can I make a humble suggestion to him . 
when he returns to Canada , why does he not get the premiers together and organize a Team Canada trip in Canada ? 
this government has the power to say to the provinces " we will give you a year to sit down with us and conclude an agreement for interprovincial trade with a dispute settlement mechanism '' . 
who would object to that ? 
surely not the government of the province of Quebec which in the 1995 referendum argued under the word partnership the value of the economic union of Canada . 
surely not those who have signed on to trade agreements with dispute settlement mechanisms with the United States and Mexico . 
why can we not have this for Canada and create jobs as we do it ? 
that is also one of the compelling reasons why such leadership should be exercised . 
so here are a few of the ideas of things that we believe in . 
in the area of health care we think this government needs to move very rapidly . 
we hope it will use the opportunity of the first ministers conference to propose a covenant in health care , to recognize that the agenda on health care in this country will not be a national agenda until the national government plays its role . 
it is fine to go out there and accuse the provinces of doing this or that . 
but they will be out there and Canadians will be in a period of uncertainty on health care until the national government offers real leadership , not denial . 
this includes recognition of national standards , a covenant in the area of health care , an agreement by the provinces to enforce those standards and also a dispute settlement mechanisms in the area of health care . 
in education and training this government could lead the way by offering some leadership on testing in the sciences and math , wiring schools , doing everything in its power to offer access to post - secondary education which it seemed to say today . 
frankly , excuse us if we are a little jaundiced , but we have heard the same words in the past and seen exactly the contrary . 
pension reform will also be very important . 
the prime minister will know that Canadians are very concerned , and they should be . 
the government has a hidden agenda . 
to put it very directly , it is proposing pension reform that is going to overwhelmingly affect middle class Canadians . 
middle class Canadians are going to get whacked by the government . 
they are going to be affected . 
the people who saved for their retirements are now going to find out that these Liberal members are going to take that away from them . 
we want the government to come clean . 
we are ready to debate it and prepare pension reform . 
how will this affect married women who are in relationships where their income will be judged on family income , not their individual income ? 
in the area of CPP we continue to support increases in premiums reluctantly . 
this is a payroll tax . 
but we equally believe that if there is going to be an increase in the premiums they must be offset by tax reductions . 
otherwise we will end up with an $ 11 billion or $ 12 billion bite out of the economy . 
it must be said that the Prime Minister knows that , for us , the national unity issue is not partisan . 
i think that we proved it in the 1995 referendum and after . 
they cannot be replaced . 
we cannot expect the provincial premiers to act on behalf of a national government . 
i would have hoped that we could turn the page on the post - Meech period and finally start building a national , a Canadian action plan . 
until we agree at least on a common action plan , we will be at the mercy of a government in Quebec whose avowed intention is to break up Canada . 
and we only react to what it does . 
the hope I place in this Parliament and in this government is that they come up with an action plan . 
nobody expects that solutions will be found overnight . 
nor does anyone expect any constitutional amendments . 
but what we want to see is the Prime Minister at least agreeing with the provincial premiers on a common plan of action . 
i would caution , however , against a plan too heavily focused on Quebec , as it currently is following the Calgary declaration , and doomed to failure because demagogues elsewhere in the country are going to seize on this and once again say that Quebec is running the country , when in fact Quebecers do not wake up every morning wondering whether they are a distinct society . 
they do not have to ask themselves the question - they are a distinct society , period . 
and while I am on the topic , they do not need anyone ' s permission to be distinct . 
except that the redistribution of powers , the federal power to spend , and the new mechanisms for co - operation affect not only Quebecers and westerners but also people in the Atlantic provinces and in Ontario . 
we will move forward if we can do so together . 
that is one of the lessons . 
the only person who can come up with that is the Prime Minister of the country . 
but our Prime Minister , unfortunately , seems disinclined to act . 
the prime minister will know that in the cabinet room in which he convenes his cabinet , as he sits down there is something written on the wall in front of him . 
the next time there is a cabinet meeting I hope he and his colleagues will take a second to read what is written there . 
fear of failure in this area of unity for Canada is not an excuse . 
plan Bs are nice but let me share with the prime minister that as far as this party is concerned they can pursue all the plan Bs they want , compete with the opposition leader in trying to be Canada ' s undertaker , but as far as this party is concerned and as far as Canada is concerned , failure is not an option and will never be an option . 
we are happy and honoured to be in the House to offer our contribution to the national debate . 
we look forward to building , continuing to build what is a great country and offering our children even more than what our own parents left to us . 
that is the true test and will be the true test of this Parliament . 
of all the things a government can effect and decide on , one important symbol is a passport . 
who would have thought 130 years ago when this country was founded that as a consequence of the work of these generations of men and women that we would pass on to our children today what is viewed as the most valuable passport in the world , in a world that is globalized , in a world where more than ever people travel - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. whip of the Reform Party on a point of order . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , when the leaders speak of course we do not want to be tight on time . 
we understand that the leader of the New Democrats went over by two or three minutes to conclude her remarks . 
when the leader of the Conservative Party asked if he would have a couple or three minutes to do the same , we are now into doubling the time allotted for his speech . 
i think it is time to wrap it up . 
this has gone on now almost 15 or 20 minutes over the allotted period . 
i ask you to ask him to bring his remarks to a close . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member has not raised a point of order . 
he is simply making a representation . 
the House extended the time and did not place a limit on the hon. member ' s time . 
i think the hon. member has expressed his view about what the extension should have been but in the circumstances , I recognize the hon. member for Sherbrooke . 
hon. Jean J . Charest : 
following the hon. member , Mr. Speaker , he could just leave if he wanted to . 
he does not have to sit and put up with this . 
i understand how difficult it must be for him to listen to all of this , but that is fine . 
i do not want to dwell on that . 
if he does not want to listen , he can just leave . 
this is something that we , as a Parliament , have a very direct effect upon . 
i hope that everyone of us here will make a commitment , will inherit that passport and be able to benefit from what is one of the greatest citizenships in the world , being a Canadian . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
pursuant to order made on Tuesday , September 23 , 1997 , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o ' clock . 
( the House adjourned at 6.17 p.m. )

parliament OF CANADA ACT 
Mr. Eug è ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 201 , an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act ( oath or solemn affirmation ) . 
presently members of Parliament swear allegiance exclusively to the Queen . 
i now present a private member ' s bill that would require the newly elected MPs when they are elected to swear allegiance to Canada and the Constitution as well as swearing allegiance to the Queen . 
i would like to thank all those members who read my proposed amendment , as I did , at the swearing - in ceremony . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am sorry but I did not see the hon. member for Abitibi second the motion when I read it .

canada HEALTH ACT 
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 202 , an act to amend the Canada Health Act ( nutrition services ) . 
the purpose of this bill is to include the terms " nutrition services " in the definition of " insured health services " within the present Canada Health Act . 
nutrition is an essential component of an individual ' s health . 
we know that Canadian dieticians are the only health professionals with the proper training and skills to assess a person ' s nutritional health . 
moreover , the Canadian government recognizes them as a key resource in drawing up health policies such as Canada ' s Food Guide , which provides guidelines for a healthy diet . 
i therefore believe that it is important , both for the public and for the professional association of dieticians , that they be officially recognized and integrated into the Canada Health Act .

agreement ON INTERNAL TRADE IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to introduce my private member ' s bill , an act to amend the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act . 
the agreement on internal trade , which was signed nearly three years ago , was a start . 
however , it has not been completed . 
the main obstacle to completion has been the term consensus which was used by the negotiating committee comprising of cabinet , representatives from the federal , provincial and territorial governments . 
this committee has interpreted consensus to mean unanimity . 
therefore , any one government , regardless of the population it represents , can impede the progress of the agreement and of the Canadian economic union . 
this is what has happened many times . 
my bill will allow the federal government to use its constitutional responsibility under sections 91 and 121 of the Canadian Constitution to complete sections of the agreement on internal trade . 
it is important to note that this action will only be taken in situations where a co - operative agreement between the provinces has been sought and has not been reached . 
this proposed approval formula will require the agreement of at least two - thirds of the provinces that have at least 50 percent of the Canadian population . 
this provision will facilitate the removal of internal trade barriers and present growth opportunities to Canadian businesses which previously have been restricted by these interprovincial trade barriers .

cultural GRANTS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ACT 
Mr. Speaker , the Liberals speak quite frequently of protecting Canada ' s culture which is a very noble cause I am sure . 
they speak of it in terms of motherhood and apple pie . 
the difficulty is that many times Canadians are appalled at the choices they make or the people who they assign to make the choices of the projects . 
furthermore , there seems to be a lack of accountability of those dollars . 
the purpose of this bill is to raise awareness of Canadians to the choices that the appointees of the Liberals are making . 
second , it will give some acknowledgement to the long suffering taxpayer . 
on the positive , it is my contention in this bill that when the decision - makers are aware that their choices are going to be made public they will be making more responsible choices .

user FEE ACT 
Mr. Speaker , this is a bill to provide for parliamentary scrutiny and approval of user fees set by federal authority and to require public disclosure of the amount collected as user fees . 
in the 1993 auditor general ' s report the AG said : " We are concerned that Parliament cannot readily scrutinize the user fees established by contracts and other non - regulatory means . 
there does not exist a government wide summary of the fees being charged , the revenues raised and the authorities under which they are established '' . 
the design of this bill is to ensure that there is scrutiny and that we get a handle on the fact that revenues from user fees have doubled in the last 10 years under Liberal and Tory governments , something that should concern all Canadians .

Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) : 
my constituents call on Parliament to urge the governor general to appoint a duly elected person to the forthcoming vacant British Columbia seat in the Senate of Canada . 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wish to table a petition from leasees of Indian Point subdivision on Adams Lake in my riding . 
most of these people are senior citizens who retired to homes on land they are leasing from the Adams Lake Indian Band . 
they are listing many grievances against the crown , including having to surrender their homes without compensation when their current lease ends in the year 2010 . 
the petitioners pray that the House of Commons will urge the federal government to compensate them . 
i strongly urge this government to grant their request .

impaired DRIVING 
Mr. Eug è ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :

the FAMILY 
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have three petitions to table today . 
the first one is from a group of residents of my riding of Cypress Hills - Grasslands who are petitioning Parliament to ensure that section 43 of Canada ' s criminal code is retained in its present form so that parents will still have their existing right to discipline their children in a reasonable manner as they see fit . 
i have two petitions to present which are identical in form and content also from residents of my riding . 
they wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , even though not officially ratified by all provinces , has ramifications that if the convention is fully ratified and implemented in Canada , bureaucrats and the courts will be legally required to determine what is the best interests of the child , not the parents ; that by ratifying the convention Canada - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order . 
the rules say the hon. member cannot read the petition . 
he may only summarize the petition in his remarks . 
i would invite him to stick to the rules in this regard and give us a summary of the petition rather than read the entire petition to the House . 
Mr. Lee Morrison : 
they request that Parliament support Motion No. 300 which states that in the opinion of the House the government should authorized a proclamation to be issued by the governor general amending section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to recognize the fundamental rights of individuals to pursue family life free from undue interference by the state and to recognize the fundamental rights and responsibility of parents to direct the upbringing of their children and urge the legislative assemblies of other provinces to do likewise .

request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
multilateral AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am in receipt of a notice of motion under Standing Order 52 from the hon. member for Winnipeg - Transcona . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 52 to seek leave to move a motion to adjourn the House for the purposes of having an emergency debate on the multilateral agreement on investment . 
with your permission I will say a word or two as to why I am seeking that emergency debate . 
this is an agreement which is presently being negotiated in the context of the OECD between Canada and other OECD countries . 
it is an agreement which when arrived at will bind Canada for 20 years . 
it will tie the hands of future Parliaments . 
it is an agreement which has not been debated in the House . 
the government has signalled no intention to have it debated in the House or to have an appropriate public consultation process . 
it is an issue which concerns a great many Canadians with respect to sovereignty and the ability of governments to act in the public interest and the increasing restrictions on that ability of governments to act in the public interest and in the common good . 
i believe it only makes sense that we use this standing order to allow ourselves the opportunity to debate this particular agreement , to hear what the government has to say and to hear what other members of Parliament have to say on this very important matter . 
speaker ' S RULING 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair has heard the representations of the hon. member and has made a review of the material submitted in respect of the application . 
while no doubt the matter is of considerable interest , the Chair does not take the view that this is a matter of emergency or one that would justify setting aside the normal business of the House in order to debate the subject . 
i note that the House is currently debating the address in reply from the Speech from the Throne which offers a very general debate in which members are free to make remarks on any subject they wish . 
i would like the hon. member to participate in that debate in respect of this matter at this time . 
government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure and an honour to take part in this reply to the Speech from the Throne which was laid before the House two days ago . 
it ensures universal quality health care for all . 
it provides every child with a fair chance in life , as the prime minister spoke so eloquently about yesterday , and it maintains a united country able to fulfill these values and reach the dreams he talked of yesterday in the House . 
the Speech from the Throne outlined Canada ' s ability to trade with and draw investment from all parts of the globe . 
this is essential to the success of that agenda . 
with regard to international trade , the Speech from the Throne addressed four key elements . 
the first outlined the important role trade plays in the economic life of Canada . 
most important , it is absolutely crucial to the creation of jobs . 
one out of three Canadian jobs is directly tied to trade . 
Canadian sales abroad come to more than a quarter of a trillion dollars . 
every $ 1 billion of trade in merchandise creates or sustains 11,000 jobs for Canadian workers . 
the benefits of trade extend to every part of our economy and affect all Canadians , the farmer who grows wheat , the engineer who designs tractors and the factory worker who builds planes . 
we are all touched by trade and we all share in its benefits . 
around the world barriers are coming down , markets are opening up and opportunities are being created which were simply unimaginable a few years ago , opportunities which are absolutely critical to Canada ' s continued economic prosperity . 
Canadians have come to the full realization that we are too small a nation to simply to trade with each other . 
second , the Speech from the Throne underscores that to take full advantage of these opportunities we must expand our trade base further . 
to do so governments must work better and smarter . 
departments must speak to each other in a consistent single message . 
we must seek closer partnerships with the business community . 
we must redefine the role our trade associations and chambers can play for business people who are seeking new markets abroad . 
expansion will ultimately mean that small and medium size businesses will have to play a greater role in Canada ' s global trade . 
they must become a more integral part and focus of our global trade strategy . 
currently only 10 percent of Canada ' s small and medium size firms directly export . 
a great number of small businesses are suppliers that feed the large corporations that do trade . 
we know there is more room to grow for small and medium size businesses in the world of export . 
while Canada is very much an exporting nation , we have not become a nation of exporters . 
fifty large corporations account for over 50 percent of Canada ' s trade . 
our goal therefore is to double the number of companies exporting by the year 2000 , which will mean a greater take up by the small and medium size firms . 
it is only logical that if we point to small businesses being the cornerstone of our domestic economy , if we speak to small businesses creating the jobs in all of our communities , it stands to reason that by increasing and encouraging more small businesses to join our large ones on the international field we will reap the very same benefits that these enterprises give our communities domestically . 
to be successful in this doubling of the number of companies which will be in the export business , it will also mean harnessing the energy and talent of our women entrepreneurs , for one - third of Canadian firms today are either owned or led by women entrepreneurs , firms that are providing almost two million jobs for Canadians across the country . 
on top of it all , women CEOs are creating jobs at a rate nearly four times the national average . 
this is a track record that we cannot ignore because clearly it is creating benefits that we cannot forgo . 
this mission will include new entries to the export field and experienced exporters who will perform the important role of mentoring . 
the cultural and educational sectors will also be part of a team marketing products that generate wealth and employment while enhancing Canada ' s image in the world and making us proud to be Canadians . 
utilizing the capacity of our modern economy and the diversity and strength of our citizens , the entire world must be Canada ' s market . 
of course we are a Pacific nation as well and our view of the Americas does not stop at the Rio Grande . 
Canadians have links to every corner of the globe . 
people and companies trade with countries they feel most comfortable with , in languages they can speak and in cultures they understand . 
that is one of Canada ' s biggest advantages . 
indeed it is Canada ' s competitive advantage in the sense that no part of the world is alien to our Canadian citizenry . 
more than anything else the team Canada missions which our Prime Minister began have demonstrated these very strengths and are broadening the spectrum of Canadians involved in global trade . 
large as well as small and medium size firms , women entrepreneurs , Canadians of all origins and backgrounds , provinces , municipalities , educational institutions , all are on team Canada thereby giving Canadians a stake in every part of the world and every part of the world a stake in Canada . 
that is why I am confident that the next team Canada voyage in January to Latin America will continue this winning tradition and above all will promote the formula that Canada works best when Canada works together . 
the third element raised by the Speech from the Throne is that we must devote the same kind of energies and effort to attracting investment as we do to stimulating trade in merchandise . 
direct foreign investment in Canada increased by some 8 percent last year , reaching almost $ 180 billion . 
investments bring us capital , research and development , as well as strategic and financial alliances that can help small businesses move from exclusively regional to world markets . 
ultimately investment generates jobs . 
for every $ 1 billion worth of investment in Canada , 45,000 jobs over a five year period are created or sustained . 
at the same time the multilateral agreement on investment which we are negotiating currently with the OECD will provide us with a secure and stable framework of rules for Canadians investing abroad . 
to promote more investment in Canada however , we must be even more aggressive in promoting Canada around the world . 
the world is growing ever more competitive by the day . 
as more countries industrialize we cannot assume that our share of global investment will remain constant . 
in fact in a number of countries while our investment and our trade is going up , our market share in that region is going down . 
it means that we cannot rest on our past laurels . 
it means that we have to compete with the best . 
we have to keep up with the Joneses and sometimes you are as good as your last trade deal . 
that is why it is a priority for me and this government to put forward the case for Canada and to remind people around the world that the country the UN found to be the best place to live is also one of the best places to work and to invest . 
finally the Speech from the Throne emphasized the leadership role that Canada plays and must continue to play in liberalizing trade around the globe . 
freer trade has been positive for Canada . 
over the past few years our export figures have increased exponentially . 
it is no accident that Canada is expected to record the highest rate of employment and growth of all the G - 7 countries this year and next . 
it is important to note however that if trade has been successful for Canada - and it has - we can attract investment and promote more trade as long as we are dealing in a transparent , rules based system of law . 
that assures nations like ours the opportunity of equal treatment with larger trading partners . 
rules for Canada and for other countries are the equalizer . 
that is why Canada must always help to write the rules and not walk away from the table where the rules are being written . 
canada is also helping to draw the countries of Asia - Pacific closer together , a region which includes the world ' s fastest growing economies . 
last year the Prime Minister signed an action plan with the European Community that speaks to a strong and dynamic future , including increased trade and investment , rather than simply resting on past glories , as great as those glories were . 
canada is also championing the free trade area of the Americas and is seeking a closer relationship with the countries of Mercosur . 
three years ago in Miami , the concept of a free trade zone of the Americas seemed a far off dream . 
three weeks ago in Brazil , I became convinced more than ever before that plans for a trade agreement covering the entire hemisphere are about to materialize . 
it is absolutely vital that Canada continues to look outward not inward , because if the world moves without you - and make no mistake that the global march is very much on - then who really gets left behind ? 
the world has experienced protectionism and has suffered through its consequences . 
the protectionist rage which snapped a golden age of trade in the U.S. in the 1930 s turned a severe recession into a great depression . 
Canadians know that we cannot build a fortress and lock ourselves inside . 
neither is our goal free trade at any cost . 
on the contrary , we must always preserve and promote the values and traditions that Canadians hold dear . 
trade and investment are simply not a matter of crunching numbers or posting figures . 
the bottom line for trade should be and must always be people , and their bottom line is jobs . 
it provides the revenue we need to maintain a quality life and a universal health care system . 
yesterday the Prime Minister talked of trying to help youngsters get on to the other side of the fence , to lower the fence and to help them see the other side which as he said is always greener . 
i believe that on the matter of trade , Canada is doing just that . 
it is jumping over that fence . 
thanks to a rules based system and thanks to an independent way of breaking those log jams , not only has Canada been able to survive , but Canada has been able to win . 
that is why we went on to sign NAFTA , and a free trade agreement with Chile , and a free trade agreement with Israel . 
Canadians obviously have recognized the absolute necessity of connecting with the bigger world outside of Canada for the purposes of keeping our economy strong and prosperous . 
canada has rare strengths and enormous potential . 
we are competent , we are competitive and we are confident . 
in the world of global trade and investment , Canada has come of age . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the minister to his new portfolio . 
as he said during his speech , trade is a very important area for Canada . 
he noted that barriers to trade are coming down worldwide and that Canada is very dependent upon trade . 
i would agree with him . 
i welcome the Liberal caucus to the area of free trade . 
one by one , the Liberals are slowly becoming believers . 
it was not always the case . 
i am concerned with the government ' s approach in a few areas and would like to ask the minister some questions on that . 
i am concerned about its approach to adopting new trade regimes around the world such as a new trade deal with Chile . 
we are now talking about one with Mercosur , which I welcome , but we have not done the homework to make it possible for our businesses to take advantage . 
we have the worst record in the G - 7 countries of trade barriers within our own country . 
as a matter of fact , we have more barriers to trade in Canada than there are in the entire European Union . 
that is simply not acceptable . 
in fact a private member ' s bill was introduced this morning by my colleague from Lakeland talking about just that . 
i would hope the Liberals on the other side would support that private member ' s bill and maybe even lift it up and adopt it as their own to get rid of the trade barriers that are limiting us . 
i am also concerned that the government is not using the processes the minister talked about to settle disputes . 
we have a very good dispute settling mechanism within NAFTA and now within the World Trade Organization . 
what happened when it came time to use them on durum wheat a couple of years ago , softwood lumber and Helms - Burton ? 
they never used the processes that were put in place . 
i want to know what the government is doing to bring down internal trade barriers in this country . 
at our committee on small and medium size enterprises we heard businesses state that they had actually moved from Ontario into Michigan because they could do better trade with the provinces in Canada that way than they could from Ontario . 
that is simply unacceptable . 
what will they do to correct this problem ? 
what will they do about using the processes we have in place to settle disputes ? 
hon. Sergio Marchi : 
Mr. Speaker , let me first congratulate my hon. friend for being appointed as his party ' s spokesperson on international trade . 
i say to him and to his colleagues that I very much look forward to working with him on this important file to the benefit , ultimately , of Canadians and the Canadian economy . 
he also touched upon the history of the Liberal Party . 
i urge him to reread the history of political parties a little more carefully . 
if he did so he would see very clearly that the history of the Liberal Party has always been one of a trade liberalizing party , a party favouring and wanting to bring down barriers . 
on the contrary , the history of the party he and many of his colleagues supported before the Reform Party , namely the Conservative Party , has always been one of protectionism and building up the walls . 
we stood up for and spoke to a rule based mechanism . 
those are the battles the Liberal Party has fought , which has resulted in the side agreements on both labour and environment and the rules we as a country need to survive and obviously do very well . 
i think the member has the history on that issue quite backward . 
our trade has shot up . 
our investments in Brazil , Argentina , Chile and Mexico have gone up . 
it has actually come from the business community for us to be facilitating trade by getting our policy signals right . 
it is very anxious to be in the free trade area of the Americas . 
obviously it is anxious to get on a plan to go with the Prime Minister to another team Canada mission in Latin America . 
yes , the member is right about internal trade barriers . 
he is absolutely right that as we liberalize trade around the world , as we look to liberalize the Americas or APEC or get closer to Europe or the United States , that somehow in a very contradictory way these ancient walls still exist in Canada . 
there was a reference in our throne speech to bringing down those walls . 
in the last meeting of the premiers I took considerable hope in the fact that all premiers but one was prepared to begin to bring down those barriers . 
we have actually tried to lead the coalition and consensus of the provinces to bring down the barriers and ultimately make those companies better prepared and more competitive to face the world . 
the member ' s last point was on dispute mechanisms . 
he said that we needed to work closely with the business community . 
on the other hand he said that we had to use those mechanisms . 
it too has to size up : " Do we go to the wall ? 
do we fight on this issue ? 
or , do we try to manage the trade so that we will forgo the kinds of expenses and the kinds of energies obviously implicit in any fight on any mechanism ? " 
i am also concerned and troubled , if it begins to set a trend , that every issue will get managed . 
managed trade is not freer trade and one way trade is a dead end . 
we have to take stock of how the industry feels on a particular issue as opposed to simply going to the wall and in the end only hurting the industry even more . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
the idea of the 10 minute question and answer period is that there be an opportunity for a number of members to rise . 
i do not know why the minister was so particularly anxious about receiving a question from the NDP that he used up all the time . 
he was asked a question and he went on and on . 
the idea is to have a variety of questions and answers . 
i did not feel that the entire 10 minutes had expired . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
there were approximately 20 to 25 seconds left in the 10 minutes and the Speaker decided to terminate it because I did not feel that a question could be asked in 20 seconds and answered in 20 seconds . 
this happened to be one of those where there was a lengthy question and a lengthy answer . 
i am sorry that the hon. member did not get a chance to ask a question , but I am sure he will have an opportunity later in the day . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I start by congratulating Mr. Speaker and his peers on ascending to the chair once again . 
i also congratulate all members of the House on their election to the House of Commons . 
it is a great privilege to be here . 
i certainly thank the constituents of Medicine Hat for placing their trust with me once again . 
i rise to address the throne speech delivered on Tuesday by the governor general . 
what criteria did the government use to determine how this formula would work ? 
what were the criteria ? 
i do not recall any consultation with the people of Canada asking them how they wanted to spend any surpluses . 
i do not remember any of that . 
two years ago when the government decided it would create a new $ 2 coin , there were consultations to decide what would go on the coin . 
however there were no consultations on what to do with the 75 billion $ 2 coins the taxpayers send to the government every year . 
there were no consultations on that , but it was very committed to ensuring that we got the $ 2 coin with the polar bear . 
the next issue implicit in the government ' s decision not to consult people is its belief that the money from the Canadian public actually belongs to the Liberal Party . 
that seems to be implicit in this . 
the issue here - and it is something successive Liberal and Tory governments have missed for a long , long time - is that money belongs to Canadian taxpayers . 
unfortunately that did not happen . 
specifically in the throne speech , once we get beyond the decision to spend 50 per cent on new programs and the decision seemingly to spend 50 per cent on tax reduction and debt reduction , we encounter the actual words in the speech . 
there is one line about tax relief and debt reduction . 
it is on page 4 and is the only reference in the whole document . 
it reads : 
where does it go after that ? 
then we hear that the government is contemplating buying helicopters , the self - same helicopters it chastised the Conservatives for wanting to buy . 
truly I wonder what is going on here . 
it is as though Pierre Elliott Trudeau never left this place . 
there is a social program in every pot . 
we should be very concerned . 
it has taken us 27 years to get out of a deficit situation but the government , ignorant of the 27 years that have gone before us , now seems intent on going back and starting to spend all over again . 
the big concern - and I am glad to see the media is raising this as well - is that the government never set a base line anywhere in the document upon which it will determine its surpluses . 
now it is very possible that it will spend all its surpluses before we even get to a surplus point . 
it is already borrowing against future surpluses . 
one question the government needs to answer very soon is what is the base line upon which it will determine what the surpluses really are . 
then we can have an honest debate within the narrow bounds the government has laid out about how much money should go to taxes and debt retirement . 
i am very critical of what is in the throne speech from an economic point of view . 
i am very disappointed . 
however , I believe it is the role of the official opposition to also offer some constructive criticism . 
i would argue that the Reform Party has done that in spades over the last few weeks by offering not only a discussion paper on some of the alternatives to what we could do with the surplus but to inform the debate and start a consultation process . 
we believe it is very important to consult with Canadians on this issue . 
it is a novel approach in this place to recognize that the money belongs to Canadians . 
they worked long and hard for it . 
in a moment I will tell the House just how long and hard they work compared to citizens from other countries around the world . 
we have produced a document called " Beyond a Balanced Budget '' . 
i want to draw from it right now to explain how the Reform Party would approach the ad hoc debate that is occurring today in the country about what to do with any surplus . 
we do that by asking seven basic questions . 
first , what is a realistic projection of future surpluses once the federal books are balanced ? 
second , what is the optimal level of government ? 
third , can these surpluses be increased by more responsible federal spending ? 
fourth , what is the optimal level of taxes ? 
fifth , what is the optimal level of debt ? 
sixth , how can we change the spending patterns of government to better reflect the priorities of Canadians ? 
seventh , if a public consensus can be achieved with respect to an appropriate level and pattern of federal spending , taxation and indebtedness , what measures are required to ensure the federal government respects those targets and lives within its means ? 
if Canadians want to read this document it is available to them on the Internet at www . Reform . ca / babb . 
i will try to remember to mention that at the end of my speech as well . 
let me go through some of those seven specific areas to lay out why the Reform Party has huge concerns about the whole approach the government is taking with what would be a surplus , if the government does not spend it all before it actually got there . 
the first point comes from the section in our document on the size of the surplus . 
what is a realistic projection of future surpluses once the federal budget is balanced ? 
the first point I want to make is that when we use the government ' s own projections we find that probably by the year 2001 or 2002 , which would be the end of its mandate , it will have a surplus of approximately $ 14 billion annually . 
that is a very conservative estimate . 
others estimate as much as $ 20 billion . 
of course , that suggests that the government will be spending about $ 7 billion to $ 10 billion on new programs every year by the end of its mandate . 
this is the same sort of increase we had in spending during the 1970 s that got us into this whole problem in the first place . 
the second section I want to touch on is the part on the optimal level of government . I point out in the second section of our paper this quote . 
" while provincial spending increased from 2.5 percent of GDP in 1960 to 6 percent of GDP in 1995 and local government spending went from 4.74 percent to almost 6 percent , signifying greater participation in the provision of direct goods and services in each province , the federal level only dipped from 6.2 percent of GDP to 4.22 percent of the GDP over the same timeframe '' . 
however , at the same time the federal government had trouble letting go . 
it cannot for a moment consider , and this was especially true under previous Liberal administrations , letting go of some power . 
in the third section we talk about that . 
$ 24 billion in surpluses under a Reform government with the chance to implement some of our ideas would mean more money for deficit reduction , more money for tax reduction and money that would go toward important programs like health care and higher education . 
in the fourth section we talk about the optimal level of taxes . 
it is important , especially after the international trade minister has spoken , to point out how much we are at a competitive disadvantage to other trading partners around the world . 
in the G - 7 Canada is the highest taxed as a percentage of personal income tax to GDP of any country , by far . 
our personal income tax rate is 52 percent higher than the rest of the G - 7 nations and 25 percent higher than the industrialized countries in the OECD . 
canada ' s personal income tax rate is through the roof . 
this has a tremendous negative impact , like the brain drain for instance . 
we lose all kinds of very highly qualified people to the United States and other countries around the world because the personal income tax burden drives them away . 
if we were able to drop those tax burdens we would have an increased labour supply , increased participation in the labour force , lower gross wage costs for employers , increased entrepreneurship and business start - up . 
there is no end of benefits to lowering personal income tax . 
it is time for the government to start to consider those things , and we want to talk to the Canadian public about it . 
in the fifth section of our paper we talk about the optimal level of debt . 
we point out the horrendous impact of the debt . 
we pay $ 47 billion in interest payments on the debt each and every year . 
that adds up to a tax burden of $ 3,518 in taxes per year or $ 295 each and every month for every Canadian taxpayer . 
if we had that money to apply to health care , we could run every single hospital in the country for two years on one year ' s interest payments on the Canadian debt . 
it is time to start reducing the debt . 
we make that argument forcefully in our paper but the government has shut off that option by deciding it is going to spend its way to prosperity . 
in the next section of the paper we talk about responsible spending . 
we point out that because of things like interest payments on the debt the federal government has reduced its transfers for health care by 35 percent . 
yesterday the health minister tried to deny that it is 40 percent , so we will grant him that it is just 35 percent , $ 6.8 billion . 
and Liberals claim to be members of the party of compassion . 
the Liberals have closed more hospitals in the country than any provincial government , yet they say that they care about Canadians . 
if they truly do , it is time for them to come to grips with the problem of the debt , with the problem of taxes . 
specifically , if they get a handle on government spending and quit spending more and more and more , they will be able to devote more money to the programs Canadians really care about . 
in the final section of our paper we talk about the need for government to be accountable . 
i know that is a novel theme in this government . 
we know the government has promised in the past to be more accountable . 
the Liberals talked of ethics , watch dogs and that sort of thing but it has never come to be . 
we argue very strongly that it is time we had balanced budget legislation . 
as we point out in our paper , a balanced budget law would be an important first step in reassuring Canadians from coast to coast that the painful tax increases and reductions in the social safety net that were made necessary by previous governments will never occur again . 
that is what is in our paper . 
we will be going across the country during the next several months asking people to help us bring forward some recommendations for the federal government , to give it a road map so it understands where Canadians are at on these important issues . 
outside of the unity debate there is probably not a more important issue that the government will deal with in its mandate , yet it has decided to shut Canadians out of the process . 
i think that is ridiculous . 
this whole debate reminds me of a mutiny . 
it is as though a mutiny has occurred on the ship of state , while the captain , the Prime Minister , is on shore golfing , and the first mate , the finance minister , is asleep in his cabin . 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage along with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Transport have taken over the helm of the ship of state - and I am borrowing an analogy which the leader of the Reform Party used yesterday - and decided to go to Sweden because that is where they saw the land of opportunity . 
however , they are going from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario but they have decided not to use the Welland Canal . 
they are going down the Niagara River . 
envision the Minister of Canadian Heritage with a parrot on her shoulder and a patch over both eyes . 
as they go down the river a din is heard in the distance . 
the finance minister , now swabbing the deck at sword point , is saying " No , I don ' t think that is applause '' . 
can you imagine what the Canadian people are saying ? 
they hear the rabble upstairs , they hear all the noise and they are very concerned because they too can hear the din . 
it is time it allowed Canadians to come up out of the hold to take control of the ship and turn it around . 
we will never in a 100 years solve the problems of the 1990 s with the solutions of the 1970 s . 
it is time for the government to wake up and recognize that Canadians have a stake in this . 
this is the most important economic decision the government will make in its mandate , the most important decision it will make as it leads Canadians into the new millennium . 
let us ensure that Canadians have a say in this . 
let us ensure that their values are reflected in the direction in which the country goes . 
let us have some appreciation for the fact that the small business people are the job creators . 
let us understand that they want to have some of the $ 13 billion EI surplus . 
let us understand that they are frightened to death that we are going to pass on a burden of $ 600 billion worth of debt to their children . 
let us have some appreciation for where Canadians are at and let us make sure that from here on the government hears what Canadians are saying . 
in the government ' s absence , the Reform Party will be there to stand up for them . 
Mr. Paul DeVillers ( Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to commend the Reform Party , both this hon. member ' s speech and the leader ' s speech yesterday . 
their rhetoric and their imagery is improving . 
unfortunately , their content and their comprehension remains at about the level of the previous Parliament . 
it was put to the people during the electoral campaign and the majority of Canadians voted for the platform , as is evidenced by the composition of the House . 
if that is not consultation , what is ? 
specifically , what is the member ' s opinion of the electoral process ? 
what is the point of going to the people with electoral platforms and having them judged and voted on ? 
Mr. Monte Solberg : 
Mr. Speaker , I would suggest it is the ultimate naivety to suggest that every Canadian across the country decided they were going to cast a vote on the basis of one line in the Liberal red book . 
my friend says it was a major plank . 
i do not recall any ads running based on the 50 percent spending promise . 
i recall all kinds of ads where the prime minister was sitting down to coffee and suggesting that things were wonderful with him , but I really do not recall those ads about the 50 percent . 
i would argue , and I think my Conservative friends over here would argue , on the big debate about national unity during the election campaign that a lot of people voted on that basis . 
a lot of people voted on the basis of cutting taxes . 
a lot of people had it in mind that there was an important issue of taxes that needed to be addressed and they cast their ballot on that . 
some people cast their ballot on the basis of the MP who was running . 
then they had elections and they won . 
by and large , they won them . 
it is extremely naive for the member to suggest that the reason that Canadians voted the Liberals in with a diminished mandate was because of their promise to spend 50 percent of any surpluses on new spending . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) : 
i listened carefully when it was being read . 
i do not remember hearing any comment . 
i reread the throne speech and I saw no reference at all to the multibillion dollar purchase of helicopters . 
it seems to me that if this were a priority of the government , it should at least have been mentioned in the throne speech . 
does he agree with me that there was no mention of the helicopter purchase and could he clarify for the House his party ' s view of the purchase of helicopters ? 
do they support spending these moneys now on search and rescue helicopters ? 
also he made comments about tax reform . 
has his party given much thought to the fact that if there is going to be any tax reduction that it be in the form of reducing the GST as a way of assisting Canadians from all parts of the country at all levels in the socioeconomic scale ? 
Mr. Monte Solberg : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate hearing from the hon. member for Kamloops . 
he always provides thoughtful questions . 
he has asked me a number of questions . 
first of all , I too have scoured the throne speech and I have yet to find the reference to the EH - 101 helicopters . 
it just is not in there . 
perhaps it was a typo . 
perhaps , on the other hand , the government is going to announce new programs each and every day which cannot all be included in this document unless it expands it dramatically . 
the member also asked about tax reform . 
tax reform is extraordinarily important . 
Canadians have talked about it for a long time . 
it is not in this document . 
when we go to town hall meetings people often ask why we do not have a flat tax in this country , why the taxation system is not simplified . 
it is not in here at all . 
my hon. friend has asked me about the GST , a very important issue . 
that is well known . 
we leave that open for Canadians to tell us to do that . 
that is part of our consultation . 
we have talked about a number of different tax reforms in our document . 
in the election campaign we argued that we would take 1.3 million Canadians completely off the tax rolls by lifting up those minimum exemptions . 
that is the Reform approach to helping low income Canadians . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question has to do with the number one issue that the member referred to . 
i would have thought the number one issue would be jobs . 
i hear people in the Reform Party stand up and say no more government programs , no more government assistance , no more need for it across this country . 
we want to be independent . 
the government programs that have been put in place for the last three years have hurt us dramatically . 
we have the breakup of families . 
i would think jobs would be number one and we cannot just do that with tax cuts . 
we have to have government programs . 
i would like to hear from the member of the Reform Party on where he stands on that . 
Mr. Monte Solberg : 
Mr. Speaker , I thought all the NDP members were at that end . 
the Reform Party plan would deliver about $ 1 billion in tax relief to Atlantic Canada . 
we argue that is a much more effective way of ultimately not only delivering money into the hands of people in Atlantic Canada and allowing them to have more money for consumption but also ultimately what it does is allow small businesses to start to spring up . 
it starts to change the economy in Atlantic Canada . 
we have outlined an entire plan to help Atlantic Canada get out of the morass that it is now in because of successive Liberal and Tory governments . 
our plan will lift Atlantic Canada up in terms of the economics of the country to the level of the other provinces . 
that is our plan . 
i do not believe that we can continue to send transfers to Atlantic Canada all the time without other reforms that go on to fix the economy fundamentally so that it can take advantage of its ties with New England and that sort of thing so that we can ultimately give Atlantic Canadians the hope that they really do need and really do deserve . 
Mr. Hec Clouthier ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to share my time with the hon. member for Leeds - Grenville . 
it is an honour for me to be in this rather august Chamber representing the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke . 
my duty is to articulate the concerns of my constituents , to be their advocate . 
but in a broader sense we as federal members of Parliament have an even greater obligation , and that obligation is greater than to our own political parties . 
that obligation is to our country . 
our mission is not merely the preservation of political power but to harness the awesome strength that we have been given and channel it toward the perpetuation of freedom , peace , prosperity and unity . 
we must not bicker among ourselves when the future of our country hangs in the balance . 
our strength as a nation will be immeasurably enhanced if we continue to foster actively an environment that is conducive to achieving even greater unity as a nation . 
we must all be invigorated by our triumphs of the past , by the magic of the present and by our hopes and dreams of the future . 
it is the endless possibilities of the future that we as parliamentarians must look toward by generously accepting new people , heartily believing in new ideas and boldly encouraging innovation . 
we must accept the value of dissent and daring and savour courageous controversy as a hallmark to courageous change . 
it is necessary to remember that in order to achieve this vision for the future we must allow those blessed with the talent to reach for a higher calling , a higher destiny , on their own merit . 
it is equally important to remember that we must help those who through no fault of their own cannot help themselves . 
there are some people who argue that the principal function of government is to clear the decks , clear the obstacles out of the way of the strong and the cream will rise to the top , whether that cream be rich and powerful individuals or rich and powerful regions of the country . 
this is wrong . 
i unquestionably defy anyone who expounds the survival of the fittest model of living . 
that may be the basis by which we describe the process of evolution , but a government must associate itself with a higher moral and philosophical order . 
a country as blessed as Canada should be able to somehow find room at the table for the hungry , shelter for the homeless , work for the idle , care for the elderly and infirmed and hope for the destitute . 
some people say that we should not care about the other people , that we should treat them with disdain , that we should charge on and do our own thing . 
we must share both benefits and burdens , strife and success fairly and equitably for the good of all . 
personally speaking , I am one from a family of ten . 
i have five sisters and four brothers . 
we do not always agree on everything , but at the end of the day we come together . 
we are one . 
no family , no political party , no province and no country which ignores its troubled regions and troubled peoples while watching others thrive and prosper can call itself justified , decent or responsible . 
it is the duty of any political party that wants to be given the mandate to lead our country in the future to reach out to all people in a non - partisan fashion . 
it is precisely this ability that marks the signature of a great leader . 
all great leaders have had an uncanny ability to take with them not only members of their own party , not only selected individuals , but with a unique combination of courage , determination , introspection and imagination an entire country . 
however , imagination is no substitute for reality , and the reality is this : when citizens stand together , we feel stronger as a country . 
my son Tyler , who is 12 , goes to a French school in Pembroke , Ontario . 
i think this is wonderful , but what is not so wonderful is that some Canadians would destroy our country for purely selfish reasons . 
if need be we must join a crusade to keep this country together . 
we must turn lethargy into energy . 
we must counter misguided passion with focused conviction . 
we must overwhelm narrow minded nationalism with broad minded federalism . 
we must overpower this scurrilous innuendo with the unmasked truth . 
the truth of the matter is that we live in a country called Canada which is acknowledged as the greatest country in the world in which to live . 
this acknowledgement comes as a result of our tremendous strengths . 
we are a very decent nation , capable of understanding , compromise and diplomacy . 
we are also a very accomplished nation . 
it was a Canadian who discovered insulin . 
it was a Canadian who invented the telephone , although considering the fact that I have two teenagers , I am not so sure about that invention for the time being . 
it was a Canadian who won two gold medals for speed skating at the Olympic games . 
however this is not enough . 
we must do more . 
we must continue to work to make sure that every yesterday is a vibrant and beautiful dream of happiness and every tomorrow is a magnificent vision of hope . 
we must continue to reach out to our fellow citizens , strengthen our bond and our identity as Canadians . 
we must continue to pursue excellence on behalf of our country Canada . 
we must continue to relentlessly challenge not only our own standards but those of the international community . 
we must continue to make our Canadian voice heard distinctly and bravely among other nations in the world . 
as their federal member of Parliament , my duty is to galvanize the will of the citizenry of the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , to represent their voice here on Parliament Hill bravely , with intense passion , fervent conviction and undying and unyielding determination so that we may travel through the 1990 s and into the next millennium proud of our noble heritage , supported by our family and friends , enriched by our diversity of talent , invigorated by our unity of vision , empowered by our infinite hope , our undying optimism and our indomitable spirit . 
this is my duty and I will do so without fear and without favour . 
let us not fail at this critical time . 
let us , yes , sprint forward together and continue to build a great country called Canada . 
i close with the immortal words of Longfellow when he said , let us work and leave behind us footprints in the sands of time . 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel ( Chambly , BQ ) : 
i want him to know that he is a perfect example of what I would never want to be . 
in this House he represents a diminished Quebec , a Quebec that has been swept under the rug , a Quebec that they want to erase from the map , the francophones that they intend to extinguish sooner or later , and as far as they are concerned , the sooner the better . 
however , if we look at the history of Canada , although people say there were two founding peoples , the francophones were here first , 150 years before the new bosses of my hon. friend opposite . 
but how many are left today ? 
they used to be the majority , but now not even 25 per cent of the population of this country speaks French . 
some of them changed sides , and he is one of them . 
he should realize that . 
it is sad but true that in a country that supports multiculturalism and has two official languages , one has been ignored and given no consideration whatsoever . 
there have always been people in the history of francophones in Canada to join those who oppose us , our adversaries , and to diminish us . 
i think the member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke is one of those , and he should be made aware of it . 
i would like to know whether the member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke acknowledges Quebecers as a people and their presence here for 350 years . 
but what is Canadian culture ? 
i would like to hear what he has to say on that . 
is it selling the Calgary stampede in Paris ? 
perhaps he could do that , but that is of no real interest to me . 
just as selling the songs of Gilles Vigneault around the world is of no interest to the Reformers . 
so , I would ask the hon. member , not knowing where he is coming from , whether he acknowledges that Canada has two peoples and , if so , how he can promote the French culture he has totally lost . 
Mr. Hec Clouthier : 
Mr. Speaker , my Canada includes Quebec and my friend opposite , even though he does not think Canada is a great and wonderful country . 
i am only a modest woodsman , but I fear he may have been hit on the head by a piece of wood . 
i cannot find the right words . 
it is great for me , I feel very strongly for that part of the country , and there is no problem . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i point out to hon. members that this is a five minute period of questions and comments following on a 10 - minute speech . 
i think we might resume debate . 
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke on his maiden speech . 
his points were well taken and I look forward to his continued participation in the debates of this House . 
i would also like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your recent appointment as Deputy Speaker of this assembly . 
i have every confidence that the team assembled possesses the necessary skills and abilities to successfully oversee the affairs of this 36 th Parliament of Canada . 
i am very happy to be here today . 
the riding of Leeds - Grenville is a dynamic mix of agriculture , business , industry , the service sector and with the support of an efficient CTC and the efforts of enlightened entrepreneurs is fast becoming a tourist destination for the world . 
as is customary in a maiden speech I would like to take this opportunity to recognize my predecessor , a man who quietly and effectively went about his work , a man whose actions demonstrated not only the political knowledge to differentiate between right and left but also a clear and fundamental understanding of the difference between right and wrong . 
he provided me with a vision of a better day as well as a weekly allowance and occasionally the keys to the family car . 
history will show that Jim Jordan was a politician who clearly cared more for the public than he ever did about public relations . 
throughout his career this approach was all too often dismissed as unsophisticated and old - fashioned but I believe he was ahead of his time . 
and as the political pundits are predicting chaos for this session of Parliament , it might serve us all well to revisit some of his qualities . 
the tough decisions and sacrifices that Canadians made have served to open doors of opportunity for us as a country . 
but we have some fundamental decisions to make . 
the key here is that we are now in a position to debate and make those decisions and not have those decisions made for us . 
one of the central themes of the throne speech was the commitment to co - operation between various levels of government . 
i was born into a family of seven boys and can attest to the fact that co - operation is far easier to preach than to practise . 
but open participation in competent , transparent processes with clear evaluation mechanisms is the key to Canada ' s continued success on the world stage . 
if the federal government is to exercise its responsibilities in a global and highly competitive world , then certain traditional provincial powers might be better exercised at the federal level . 
when we talk of a collaborative approach to strengthening and modernizing Canada ' s social union , let elected representatives focus on allocating powers to the government level where the interests of Canadians , not politicians , will be best served . 
i was particularly pleased to hear the reference in the throne speech to environmental technologies and the potential for growth and global leadership . 
if we commit to targeting this vital sector with the goal of developing commercially viable , sustainable development practices , then we as a nation will not only have demonstrated the ability to live within our means , but we will also have developed the capacity to live within our world . 
i want to be clear about this concept . 
it does not involve disadvantaging Canadian companies by enforcing high output standards . 
certainly , regulation is required . 
but we need to put our collective energies into how governments can support sustainable practices given the self - policing concepts of profit and competition inherent in free markets . 
Canadian firms will be able to expand into emerging markets with higher quality products at lower prices because of , not in spite of , sustainable practices . 
the political risks of such initiatives are being eliminated as successes are being documented . 
the popularity of recycling programs demonstrates that when efforts toward sustainability can be brought into a legitimate arena , the public will respond . 
the challenge for us then is to clearly bring all aspects of sustainability into the realm of legitimacy . 
that is going to require some fundamental shifts in thinking and a healthy dose of collective effort . 
business and engineering schools will need to begin to teach decision making models and algorithms that incorporate comprehensive costing principles . 
certainly , disposal and remanufacturing costs are every bit as real as inventory and transportation costs . 
industry will need to recognize sustainable growth as the opportunity that it is . 
as we continue to saturate markets and as technology shortens traditional product life cycles , the latent demand for this sector will present Canadian companies with opportunities to develop and market proprietary technologies globally . 
companies will need to work in consultation with the government to ensure that policies such as lifetime product stewardship have appropriate phase in periods to allow for the necessary design changes . 
the government needs to show leadership through co - operative domestic regulation and aggressive global negotiations to allow the industries committed to the future to prosper and grow . 
i have every confidence that Canada can and will be at the leading edge of sustainable technologies . 
the throne speech also directed necessary resources toward the problem of youth unemployment . 
the lack of secure employment manifests itself in any number of social symptoms . 
by treating the problem we can begin to break some of the cycles that served to frustrate the youth of this country . 
as a representative of a riding that has seen its fair share of downsizing and restructuring , although the youth need jobs , so do the displaced workers . 
we must strive to address both the long and short term requirements of society . 
as a government we must strike a balance between the present and the future . 
the throne speech outlined a strategy for expanding opportunities in aboriginal communities . 
as I worked on the text of this response to the throne speech , I spent a great deal of time and energy struggling with the semantics of the complex concept of sustainable development . 
i regret the fact that time does not allow me to comment on all aspects of what I truly believe is an enlightened framework , but there are a few more points I would like to mention . 
it strikes me as we talk of the new millennium that January 1 , 2000 is a day after December 31 , 1999 . Let us not miss the opportunity to accomplish as much as we did in the last two years in the next two years . 
let us commit to working toward , not simply planning for , the new millennium . 
in key areas of challenge such as unity , health care , crime and poverty the speech contained a common theme . 
there is considerable evidence to support that early and aggressive intervention can be correlated to positive long term outcomes . 
as my predecessor would have said , an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . 
let us remember that democracy is a precious thing but it is merely a means and not an end . 
it is what we choose to do in this place , not the fact that we are in this place that transforms shared values into actions . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my comments and statements will be brief . 
that is how good it was back then . 
under the current policies it would have cost my family $ 8,000 to immigrate to this great country and he is talking about what a great society it is and how great and wonderful it is . 
i would like to see him answer to my parents or any new immigrants coming to this country who will have to pay $ 8,000 for a family of eight to immigrate so they could receive the opportunities he has so eloquently described . 
the Liberal Party should also be thanking all those millions of people they have placed in poverty , especially our children , under their scorchers policies . 
they are following the Reform right down in a rush to the bottom . 
they are ripping up labour contracts and denying people their basic rights . 
Mr. Joe Jordan : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
i was describing where I think we need to go as a country . 
we certainly face challenges . 
i caution the member that this notion that the good old days were comprehensive good old days is deeply rooted in myth . 
if this country were bankrupt , the problems the member is describing , which I do not deny exist , would be compounded right up the social ladder . 
it is important that as members we try to at least deal in reality . 
by painting pictures of things that may not happen is not serving the interests of Canadians . 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate both of my colleagues who spoke for the first time in this House . 
they spoke about the throne speech which was about vision , hope and confidence . 
they spoke with pride at being elected to this place . 
their families are here in the gallery filled with pride as they have listened to their family members speak in a place where so few of us ever have the opportunity to come and in an environment of freedom and free speech speak our minds and say what we believe . 
i am struck as a new member by the differences and the similarities . 
certainly the difference that I heard from the throne speech has been echoed by my colleagues who stood with pride to speak about a document that was about confidence , vision and hope . 
what I have heard in response troubles me . 
this is an opportunity for us in a non - partisan way to share our thoughts and views . 
i would ask my colleagues , if they came to this House in a spirit of positive nation building , which I know they did , how they feel today to know that not everyone shares the goals of building together and working for this nation . 
i feel sad that there are those who would tear this country apart . 
i believe that my constituents in the wonderful riding of Thornhill expect all of us to do what we can to solve the problems that we face in a positive and constructive way . 
i congratulate my colleagues for putting forward their vision and speaking to the throne speech document which I think shares the vision of hope , confidence and nation building that should permeate this place . 
Mr. Paul Mercier ( Terrebonne - Blainville , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , history has shown that , when two peoples exist within a single nation , they each come to understand that it is in their mutual interest to separate . 
this was the case with the Austrians and the Hungarians before the 1914 - 18 war . 
i imagine my hon. colleague denies Quebec ' s right to separate . 
perhaps he could tell me if it is because he does not consider Quebecers a people ? 
Mr. Joe Jordan : 
Mr. Speaker , certainly the world has regions that are separating . 
however , I would like to remind the hon. member that if he looks at the very regions he is talking about that their desire to enter NATO and their desire to enter the European Union clearly points to the fact that together these groups have a much stronger presence and a much higher quality of life . 
the partisan feelings that would suggest that we could make it better on our own or that somehow life would be better if we split up certainly do exist . 
but if we look at the world , that is clearly the minority opinion . 
in Canada we have not only two cultures but three . 
with the aboriginal community , the French community and the English community , Canada will be much stronger . 
i think the people of Canada are starting to realize that . 
that might very well explain some of the frustration that I am seeing across the way . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment . 
first of all , I would like to thank my fellow citizens of the riding of Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot who have put their trust in me again in the last election . 
i was outraged by the speech from the throne that was delivered two days ago . 
it was riddled with misrepresentations , distorting reality with respect to the existence of a Quebec people , among other things . 
on the subject of misrepresentation , I would like to focus on two elements of the throne speech : public finances and national unity . 
as far as public finances are concerned , we must refer to page 4 of the throne speech , which reads , and I quote , " This 36 th Parliament opens at a time when we have brought order to our public finances '' . 
the speech goes on to say " The government will continue to be vigilant and responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in order '' . 
i almost fell backwards when I read that , because the Minister of Finance has been anything but responsible in his last three budgets . 
the Minister of Finance can boast about our public finances being in order . 
why ? 
because they are the ones who had to do his " dirty job '' . 
he did not do a thing to bring about the conditions that will result in a zero deficit as early as next year . 
fifty four per cent of federal spending cuts were made in social programs . 
the Minister of Finance cut $ 4.5 billion from federal transfers to the provinces for education , health and social assistance . 
this is the least it can do after collecting an additional $ 23 billion since 1994 . Taxpayers are getting a little treat from the finance minister after years of tightening their belts . 
third , it is easy to boast about bringing order to our public finances , considering that the finance minister literally robbed workers and employers by improperly dipping into the employment insurance fund . 
last year , the minister pocketed $ 5 billion , even though it has been years since the federal government contributed to the employment insurance fund . 
this year , the minister will take $ 7 billion from that fund . 
so , it is easy to boast and to brag , but taxpayers will not forget that the Minister of Finance made himself look good at the expense of Quebecers and Canadians . 
what did the minister himself do in all this ? 
what was his own contribution ? 
departmental spending has been cut by only 9 per cent over the last four years . 
the minister has not made even half the effort demanded of those who are ill , of students , of the most vulnerable members of society , especially welfare recipients , or of those who would normally re - qualify for employment insurance , but , because of the new employment insurance policy introduced last January , find themselves back on welfare . 
here too , he can go on about how unemployment is down . 
of course it is . 
the unemployment figures , meaning the number of people actively looking for work , have dropped , but entire families are now stuck on welfare because of the minister ' s new employment insurance policy , which also happens to be generating surpluses that he is using to reduce the deficit . 
these folks no longer show up in the official unemployment figures . 
this is not what being a responsible government means . 
what is our charming Minister of Finance going to do with the surpluses he is generating ? 
he will move right into areas of provincial jurisdiction . 
do you know why ? 
because the throne speech , just like the first throne speech we heard in this House , tells us that the federal government will be barging into areas of provincial jurisdiction , including education . 
all these investments being announced in Quebec ' s areas of jurisdiction , after what they did to Quebec ' s public finances in particular , have been in the works since March 1996 . 
if I may , I will quote the President of Treasury Board who , in the March 8 , 1996 edition of Le Soleil , publicly admitted the federal government ' s strategy , a strategy which consisted of dumping its problems of public funding onto the provinces , getting the provinces to do the dirty work , so that it can come out looking good to all of the taxpayers . 
to quote the President of Treasury Board in the March 8 , 1996 edition of Le Soleil , " When Bouchard - he does not even have the decency to show a little respect for the Premier of Quebec - will have to make cuts , those of us in Ottawa will be able to demonstrate that we have the means to preserve the future of social programs '' . 
such is the strategy of the federal government : to make Quebec look like the bad guy when it comes to social programs and to the health sector , when in fact they are the main ones responsible . 
they then come along with great fanfare to announce that they will be putting programs in place , that they will help our young people and improve the health system . 
such behaviour is odious and absolutely hypocritical , particularly when it is at the expense of the least advantaged and the sick . 
our campaign platform was clear with respect to sound management of public finances , as well as the battle against poverty . 
our program had six points , basically . 
the first was that we were calling upon the federal government , since public finances are getting in better shape , to give back what it has swiped from the provinces , that is to say return the $ 4.5 billion it has stolen yearly from social programs in order to fund social assistance , postsecondary education and health . 
these are no small amounts we are talking about . 
and for all of the social programs , every time a dollar was cut from social programs in Quebec , 78 cents of it were used to reduce the Minister of Finance ' s deficit . 
next , considering that the country ' s financial situation has improved , we asked the government to reduce employment insurance premiums . 
not a cosmetic 6 cent per $ 100 of insurable payroll . 
we suggested a reduction of about 30 cent per $ 100 . 
why ? 
for the simple reason that the Bloc Quebecois is on the side of jobs and job creation . 
if the government meant what it said when it talked about job creation , it would have consistently reduced employment insurance premiums , because they kill employment . 
any direct payroll tax as substantial as employment insurance premiums is bound to kill employment . 
so , since the government ' s finances are in better shape , instead of this nickelling and diming , instead of these intrusions in Quebec ' s jurisdictions , without so much as a by your leave , because it is so important to hand out cheques with a big Canadian flag , the Liberal government should consider what people need and put more money into the employment insurance fund and social programs . 
my third point is that since the new employment insurance system came into effect last January , the benefits and usual protection for workers who lose their jobs were greatly reduced . 
the fourth suggestion we made in our campaign platform , and it is still valid , is to have a targeted tax reduction . 
not the kind of generalized , useless tax reduction which does nothing to stimulate consumer buying and job creation , but targeted reductions based on a logical analysis of the tax system . 
we also put forward a document on improving personal taxation to make the system fairer and to ensure that families , especially low and medium income ones with children , get the benefit of such reform . 
we repeat the suggestion to the Minister of Finance that this tax reform should take place in his second mandate . 
if he was too sluggish in his first mandate to implement our suggestions , which , I would point out , are currently being used by Canadian universities as a good example of tax reform , he should be delighted and accept the proposals of the Bloc Quebecois . 
in this mandate , however , I think that it would be a good idea for him to make the tax system fairer for lower income classes and not just for his millionaire and billionaire friends and those of the Liberal Party of Canada . 
our fifth proposal would increase tax benefits from $ 850 million to $ 2 billion , adding $ 1.15 billion in child tax benefits . 
this is a real battle against child poverty . 
i think that , with the developments in public finances , it is not too late for the Minister of Finance to do the right thing . 
sixth , it is not hard to understand , in fact it is quite simple : if the federal government minded its business and refrained from interfering in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction , I am sure it would save money . 
every time the federal government announces with fanfare plans to get involved in education , to put an education program in place , to meddle in health issues and every other area under Quebec ' s exclusive jurisdiction , that costs money . 
and , in spite of his financial position , the finance minister is not paying for all this , the taxpayers are . 
every instance of duplication and overlap in programs entails administration costs borne by taxpayers . 
taxpayers are also paying twice for federal government employees to do the exact same job as Quebec government employees . 
the public must know that . 
that is what I mean by distorting the reality behind public finances . 
something else in this speech from the throne struck me ; I was quite shaken by it . 
it contains , on page 7 , third paragraph , a line as disgraceful as they come , in my view , and I quote , " Our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding '' . 
a nation ' s aspiration to sovereignty is not based on any misunderstanding . 
almost half of all Quebecers voted yes , but did so based on a misunderstanding . 
this is probably the most preposterous statement I ever heard . 
if there were misunderstandings in the history of the relations between Quebec and Canada , they were on the federal side . 
there were of course a number of such misunderstandings , but I targeted four . 
these misunderstandings go as far back as 1867 . 
at the time , it was believed that our French Canadian ancestors and the English Canadians had signed a historic accord between two sovereign nations , two founding peoples . 
however , over time , we came to realize that such was not the case . 
over the decades , English Canada shrank the scope of this confederation agreement . 
English Canada will not admit at all that Quebec is different . 
in fact , if we look at the throne speech , we realize that it not only denies that there is any difference , but also that it denies the existence of a distinct society , a distinct culture and , more importantly , the existence of a distinct people . 
the throne speech reinforced this first historic misunderstanding . 
it is a true misunderstanding and it originates with the members across the way . 
the second historic misunderstanding was to have believed that , in 1982 when Pierre Elliott Trudeau patriated the Canadian Constitution without Quebec ' s agreement , we would get down on our knees and agree to this Constitution that we never wanted . 
Quebecers stood their ground and I am proud of that . 
we never agreed to this Constitution . 
the third historic misunderstanding , and again it originates with the members across the way , is to have thought that , in order to make amends for the historic affront of the 1982 patriation , they could toss any little scrap our way after the failure of the Meech Lake accord and we would go for it , in order to put the problem behind us once and for all , with no regard for our pride or our wish to build a strong Quebec . 
they gave us Beaudoin - Dobbie , Beaudoin - Edwards , the Spicer Commission report , and the Charlottetown accord , which was put to a referendum and defeated . 
they came to us with completely meaningless concepts , empty shells , such as the rather comical idea of principal homeland . 
now , after the Calgary declaration , they have come up with unique character . 
Quebecers are not interested . 
Quebecers will do exactly what they did to every other meaningless offer they received concerning Quebec ' s future and reject it out of hand . 
Mr. Bourassa had gone much further , and if Daniel Johnson agrees to bow and scrape for mere crumbs , he will go down in history as having bowed and scraped for just that , mere crumbs , putting his electioneering interests before Quebec ' s true interests . 
so was English Canada ' s paternalism . 
we will be hearing a great deal about this with four federalist parties represented in the House of Commons . 
but it does not work any more . 
perhaps plan B could have worked at another time , but it will not now . 
the Supreme Court and its judges will not change the course of history . 
i have a word of warning for those across the way who may be tempted to crow over the results of recent polls . 
these polls are no referendum , but let me tell you that , when one is called , Quebecers will speak . 
they will speak loud and clear and , this time , the will say yes for real and that will be the last referendum in the history of Canada . 
i would now like to address my Canadian friends in their own language , if I may . 
the only way for our common future is not the status quo but the independence of Quebec , a new relationship , a new partnership with Canadian citizens . 
whether or not you want this partnership does not change anything . 
nothing will stop the determination of my people , the Quebec nation , to reach liberty , to become a sovereign country . 
the next referendum will be the right one . 
neither your political representatives , Liberal , Conservative , Reform or NDP , nor the judges of the Supreme Court will change anything . 
you could not force 7 billion Quebeckers to stay in Canada against their desire . 
our aspirations are legitimate and deeply democratic . 
they do not rely on justice to be planned . 
the respectable attitude of Tony Blair , Prime Minister of United Kingdom , with Scottish and Welsh people must be for you a source of inspiration . 
i am convinced that Quebecers will heed F é lix ' s advice in the next referendum . 
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member spoke of tough cuts that were made and dealt with surpluses and what the government should do . 
when the member insults the Minister of Finance and the government he is insulting Canadians right across this great country and in his province as well . 
those are the people who sacrificed to get the budget back in order . 
those steps were necessary . 
i also challenge the hon. member to come forth and be positive rather than threatening Canadians across the country . 
i also remind the member that he does not represent the entire Quebec province but one riding . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier : 
Mr. Speaker , with all due respect to my colleague , I would like to correct three things he has just said . 
first , I never said anything to insult the Minister of Finance . 
i criticized his budget policy because I consider it savage . 
if anyone has been insulted in the past four years , it is the poor families in Canada , the sick and the students , who have suffered from the savage cuts of the Minister of Finance and his government . 
second , I would like him to know that , in this House , we are elected to represent all the people in our riding and all the people of Quebec , be they federalist or separatist . 
whatever my colleague may think , and I will close on this point , the Bloc Quebecois represents 60 per cent of Quebec ridings . 
it therefore represents a majority of Quebecers . 
furthermore , we will be here in the coming years to remind him of the past and present realities of Quebec and of its aspirations . 
that may be distressing , but that ' s life . 
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened attentively to the member ' s remarks . 
i think it is appropriate to remind the member that one of the greatest destabilizing factors to investment in the province of Quebec is the constant threat of separation especially when corporations think about expanding their plants . 
members will know that we are in an economy right now where things are very much on the rebound , people are being hired and plants are being expanded . 
business looks for stability and business needs stability . 
the member , a respected economist , knows full well that this constant irritant , constant threat of destroying this country is a disincentive to investment which is really hurting those constituents looking for jobs . 
i think that when the member talks about the economy and caring and sharing , about those people who are most in need , as he did in his speech , those are the ones who are looking for work . 
and the best way for them to get work is to ensure that the businesses in Quebec that feel they want to expand feel they will be able to survive in a very healthy , stable marketplace and not one that is under a constant cloud of separation . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , for the past two years , private and foreign investment in Quebec has reached record proportions , in spite of the constitutional debate . 
and I may remind the hon. member that Quebecers are not the only ones responsible for the fact this debate exists . 
if we look at the history of relations between Quebec and Canada , part of the responsibility for this problem is yours as well . 
i can assure hon. members that if they were to accept our partnership offer , because we sovereignists are giving them that chance , an offer of partnership after a vote in favour of sovereignty , everything the hon. member said about economic growth and employment in Canada and Quebec would be settled . 
it seems to me this is perfectly clear . 
i think what is happening today in the United Kingdom is marvellous . 
if Canadians like you were to show the same understanding for the history and destiny of the people of Quebec , I think it would be easier for all concerned . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I share the same views as my friend from Broadview - Greenwood on this question . 
the hon. member , in his thoughtful presentation , referred to the plight of Canada ' s children . 
i think we sometimes assume that it is just a matter of fact that we have to have poor children . 
we have to have people who do not have jobs and who are living in poverty . 
i might want to remind my hon. friend , who probably does not need reminding , being the economist that he is , that there are many countries in the world where child poverty does not exist . 
i refer specifically to countries like Norway and Denmark where children do not live in poverty because their parents do not live in poverty . 
poverty is not something that we have to accept as a reality . 
it seems to me that in a country as rich as ours we should not have the number of children living in poverty and suffering today because their parents are living in poverty . 
considering the situation that exists in what has to be the wealthiest country in the world , would the hon. member not agree that this is actually , to quote the Catholic bishops , a form of child abuse for a government to allow this condition to continue ? 
Mr. Yvan Loubier : 
i agree with the NDP member , Mr. Speaker . 
it is rather despicable to see the Minister of Finance and government members place their hands on their hearts and talk about the plight of children , given that they themselves are responsible for a situation which has gotten worse over the last three years . 
it is not normal to make cuts based on a budget plan tabled by the finance minister in 1996 , to slash , year after year on a cumulative basis , the budget for social programs by some $ 42 billion , and to think this will have no impact on child poverty . 
the government should give us some credit . 
there is no doubt that the decisions made by this government have had an impact on child poverty and made parents poorer . 
parents got poorer as a result of , among other things , the employment insurance program implemented in January , which consistently reduces benefits and which also excludes many adult workers from the labour force . 
these people have to rely on welfare . 
so , do not try to appeal to our emotions . 
we are not going to be fooled by the finance minister ' s crocodile tears . 
it is not right to present things in that light . 
the minister should admit he made a mistake in his plan and he should at least put aside the budget cutting scheme developed in 1996 . 
do you know what the government is doing ? 
the federal government will cut $ 42 billion from transfers for social assistance , post - secondary education and health . 
it is despicable to present things as if the government was handing out goodies when in fact it is merely cutting somewhat less than anticipated in 1996 , but with the same slash - and - burn approach . 
the minister should have the decency to rise , to tell the truth and to announce that he is immediately putting an end to his planned cuts for the next three years . 
this would be an effective way to fight poverty , particularly child poverty . 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak - Lindell ( Nunavut , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to inform the House that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Simcoe - Grey . 
i would also like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your recent appointment as our Deputy Speaker . 
[ editor ' s Note : 
member spoke in Inuktitut . ] 
thank you for this opportunity to speak in the House of Commons . 
it it a great honour to be back in this Chamber . 
i say back because in 1975 I sat here in the House of Commons as a student participating in a model Parliament in seat 113 . 
i did not think then that I would be representing Nunavut 22 years later . 
i am proud to be the first female in the history of my riding to sit in the House of Commons and even more proud to be of Inuit descent . 
[ editor ' s Note : 
member spoke in Inuktitut . ] 
i thank my constituents for the privilege of representing them at this crucial point in the future of Canada and Nunavut . 
it spans three different time zones and the population is roughly 25,000 people . 
the land covers fiords , mountains and tundra . 
while I was travelling through the communities in my campaign I could not help thinking it was truly a lesson in geography . 
my constituency goes north to the North Pole , west to the Alberta - B.C. border , south to James Bay and east almost to Greenland . 
Nunavut has many international borders including Russia , Denmark and the United States . 
this vast and untouched area has great potential for a natural resource based economy . 
each year more exploration is going on in the north , in particular mineral exploration . 
Nunavut ' s high Arctic hosts two lead and zinc mines . 
this activity benefits northern communities by creating jobs for our population . 
we need continued support for sustainable development and training in this sector . 
alongside this is the challenge of protecting our environment . 
we have to make sure our land remains natural and beautiful . 
we need to promote fisheries and the processing of country food . 
this along with tourism are areas that create employment in the north and must be explored as valid industries . 
one of the mandates of the Government of Nunavut is to staff its public service with a 50 per cent Inuit workforce . 
this is a realistic goal considering that the Inuit population of Nunavut is over 80 per cent and the working language will be Inuktitut . 
as we speak the Government of Canada and the Government of the Northwest Territories are training Inuit to staff Nunavut ' s public service . 
Nunavut Arctic College has been instrumental in making education accessible and relevant to all Nunavut residents . 
last week in Iqaluit I witnessed the signing of a training agreement between the two governments that will ensure the employment targets are met . 
although governments are now training to staff the public service there have to be mechanisms in place to keep our youth in school and to pursue post - secondary education . 
there are many barriers that stand in the way of our youth attaining higher education . 
one avenue to keep youth in school is through athletics . 
there needs to be more focus on partnering schools and sport . 
twenty - seven out of twenty - eight Nunavut communities are coastal communities but all are serviced only by air . 
there are no roads . 
air freight is the only reliable way to ship goods and perishable food . 
communities receive non - perishables like fuel and construction material by sea lift , many of them only once a year . 
freight is the primary reason for the high cost of living in Nunavut . 
the constituency that I represent cannot be compared to any other part of the country . 
when I was in Iqaluit , the future capital of Nunavut , it was mentioned that Canadians are as ill - informed about their north as Americans are about Canada . 
when I was going to high school in Ottawa I was asked before Christmas break by a classmate to bring back a stamp from my home so she could have one for her collection . 
this is one example of how true it is that Canadians forget that their country goes much further beyond 60 ° north . 
we are part of Canada and proud to be Canadians . 
when people outside the north think of the Arctic , they think of igloos , polar bears , and arts and crafts . 
carvings and crafts are a legitimate source of income to many families in the north and are relied upon to put food on the table . 
we have tremendously talented artists who need to have their work marketed . 
therefore it is very disturbing for me to see imitation art displayed in stores . 
no one can replace the beauty of an original carving of the north . 
means to promote economic development of art must be explored . 
if any culture is truly unique and different within Canada , it is the Inuit culture . 
our ancestors came here thousands of years ago , lived off the land and adapted to dramatic changes . 
in the span of roughly 35 years , Inuit went from igloos to houses , from dog teams to airplanes , and still kept their culture alive because we still use igloos and dog teams . 
during my parents ' time , Inuit used fox tags and wooden sticks to trade for supplies . 
today my father has a Visa card and my mother can use her Interac card to do her banking , even though they do not speak any English . 
the Inuit are a very adaptable people and I am very proud of the progress we have made in such a short time . 
these examples show that Nunavut residents are ready for the challenges that await them . 
the implementation of our long awaited territory is rapidly approaching and co - operation between parties involved is necessary . 
i look forward to working with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , the Interim Commissioner of Nunavut , the president of Nunavut Tunngavik , and the government of the Northwest Territories to make sure that Nunavut residents see a smooth transition on April 1 , 1999 which is less than 580 days away . 
all of these parties , along with regional Inuit organizations , Qikiktani Inuit Association , Kitikmeot Inuit Association and Kivalliq Inuit Association , will be essential in providing me with real input as we face tough decisions . 
the division of the Northwest Territories is the most significant and exciting event taking place before the turn of the century . 
it has not been since 1949 when Newfoundland joined Confederation that something of this magnitude has occurred in Canada . 
establishing the Nunavut territory is my priority as Nunavut ' s member of Parliament , but it must also be a priority of this House . 
this is monumental . 
i urge my colleagues in this House to take this chance to participate in making history in Canada . 
it will be by working together and helping each other that we will accomplish the task . 
this is the way the Inuit culture survived thousands of years in a harsh and unforgiving climate . 
i was pleased to see this type of co - operation during the unfortunate crises of the floods in Quebec and Manitoba . 
i want to close this speech by extending an invitation to those members of this House and those Canadians from across the country who have not yet had the privilege to see Nunavut to come and visit us . 
i guarantee that their experience will be unforgettable . 
[ editor ' s Note : 
member spoke in Inuktitut ] 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
i want to congratulate the hon. member for Nunavut . 
i want to say to her that I had an opportunity during the last sitting of the House to work with her people with respect to their needs . 
i look forward to working with them once again . 
she is absolutely right . 
she has a unique culture and she understands , like we understand over here , that there are regions of Canada with different needs . 
we are there to help them . 
i look forward to meeting with the hon. member to discuss how we can assist her in creating the Nunavut territory and making it a better place for her people to live . 
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too want to pay tribute to the member for Nunavut . 
in my riding , they would tell her in Inuit : 
[ editor ' s Note : 
Abitibi covers 802,000 square kilometres , and has 92,000 inhabitants , 68 communities and 68 mayors . 
there are 14 Inuit villages in Abitibi . 
so I am very familiar with the Inuit culture . 
i would like to mention to the hon. member that it is true that , while in the south bread sells for between $ 1 and $ 1.06 , in Nunavut , New Quebec , bread can cost between $ 2.50 and $ 3 . 
we have many problems right now . Housing is one of them . 
i realize that much needs to be done . 
there are many who say that people in the north are receiving subsidies , but there is one thing that needs to be pointed out to the citizens of Canada and of Quebec and that is that , for every dollar we give our Inuit friends , 97 cents always comes back to the south . 
they are participating in the economy . 
we will play our part . 
i wish to congratulate the hon. member on her election . 
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I took great pleasure in listening to the hon. government member talk about the beauty and the uniqueness of the part of the country she is from . 
certainly I agree with her . 
what is really interesting is that she basically confirmed everything the Reform Party has been saying for so many years , that every part of this great country of ours is unique and distinct and has its own unique and distinct character . 
it is very refreshing to hear a Liberal member agree with the Reform Party and take a route other than saying how unique and distinct the province of Quebec is . 
i thank the hon. member for bringing that up . 
Ms. Nancy Karetak - Lindell : 
Mr. Speaker , I know that Canada is a country known for respecting all the different nationalities that come to it . 
we are very proud to be one of the original nationalities , but I believe that Canada has room for all the different people who come to this country . 
i am proud to be a part of it . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too would like to congratulate the new member for Nunavut on her maiden speech in the House of Commons . 
i had the opportunity to travel to that part of the world a year and a half ago with Canada ' s foreign affairs committee , which was studying the Arctic Council in that area . 
i was greatly impressed . 
it is one of the few ridings in Canada that is bigger than my own . 
i come from Peace River in northwestern Alberta and I can understand the difficulties in representing a riding of that size . 
i was also struck by the impact of pollutants in Canada ' s Arctic and how they can affect people living in the area . 
i have worked long and hard as the trade critic for our party to try to resolve the European ban on leg - hold traps and products from those traps from entering Europe . 
my understanding is that an agreement has been reached . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the member ' s time for questions and comments has expired . 
if the member could have a very very brief response , please do so . 
Ms. Nancy Karetak - Lindell : 
Mr. Speaker , as far as I know that is being put into place . 
we have had a bit of resistance to the changing of the traps . 
as I said in my speech , Inuit are very adaptable people . 
we are trying to go with the change . 
i have to research this a little more because as I said I am very new at this and it is such a large territory with so many topics . 
i hope I can answer it more satisfactorily with a bit of research . 
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too want to congratulate the hon. member for Nunavut . 
i am sure she will represent her riding with a passion unparalleled . 
an area of 1.9 million square kilometres certainly brings a new meaning to door to door at election time . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate you on your recent appointment . 
i take this opportunity to publicly congratulate the hon. member for Niagara Centre on his re - election as Speaker of the House . 
i am sure I speak on behalf of all of my new colleagues when I say that his words and actions have instilled a confidence in all of us based on the characters of those who are chairing this House . 
i want to thank the constituents of Simcoe - Grey . 
it is a responsibility that I do not take lightly . 
i want to assure all my constituents that I have ample access and little restrictions with regard to my input in voicing their comments or concerns to our government . 
i commit to them that I will take full advantage of this opportunity to voice their feelings . 
i have made a special commitment to my riding , one that I hope all residents will join me in no matter what their party affiliation . 
that commitment is to work hard to maintain and enhance what we believe to be the best place in Canada , and that means the world . 
i ask my constituents to join in that challenge . 
my riding is a diverse and precious place just like the people within it . 
the agriculture industry in Simcoe - Grey represents the largest geographical make - up and is the largest single employer in our riding . 
we are a rural riding that has made and will make an enormous contribution to Canada as a whole . 
to touch on a few of those contributions , I remind the House of Sir Frederick Banting , as was mentioned earlier , the co - founder of insulin and a World War II hero . 
recent contributions have been made by Sue Palmer and Paul Shaw , two of Canada ' s Olympic athletes . 
i could spend the rest of the day talking about our many contributions and how proud I am to be a part of Simcoe - Grey riding but time does not permit it . 
from our dairy , poultry , cattle and swine producers in Alliston , Elmvale , Markdale and Stayner to the best apple growers in the world in and around Thornbury and Collingwood , these farms are an integral part of Canada ' s food producing industry and deserve the support and confidence of the federal government . 
i am very pleased to see that happening . 
Simcoe - Grey is a riding that leads in agricultural excellence . 
for this reason I am extremely pleased that the Liberal government has continued to support the agricultural community in the form of marketing boards and quotas . 
i am especially pleased to see the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food leading this industry into the next century . 
as a result of his extensive background the minister understands that agriculture is the very foundation of this country and must be maintained no matter what countries or trade agreements try to threaten that foundation . 
the farming community can be assured that I will continue to support and endorse this agenda very aggressively . 
as I mentioned earlier , my riding is very diverse . 
our industrial components had their very foundations shaken , some even destroyed , throughout the mid to late eighties and early nineties . 
now , thanks to a strong and fiscally responsible government , we have provided a stable and strong economic environment to allow these industries to rebuild and strengthen their positions in Canadian and world markets . 
at long last there is a glow of optimism within industry . 
i also want to take this time to thank the Prime Minister and his previous government for having the fortitude to take us from what was near certain economic ruin to a healthy deficit free economy in four short years . 
i am very grateful for the vision and direction of my colleague , the Minister of Finance . 
his fiscal formula has been a remedy for success . 
the formula worked . 
like all ridings across Canada , jobs are at the forefront of the constituents ' minds in Simcoe - Grey . 
i commend the Prime Minister for partnering with the private sector and leading trade missions abroad . 
i encourage the federal government , as I will encourage my riding , to take these types of proactive steps . 
for our children it is a legacy in which I would like to put a serious dent , of course always keeping in mind Liberal values and social responsibilities . 
we are known worldwide as a compassionate society with very liberal values . 
now that our house is back in order , it will be necessary for us to focus more strongly on these issues . 
Simcoe - Grey is likely one of the most well - known tourist destinations in Canada . 
if it is not , I will certainly make sure it is by the end of this term . 
for this reason I was extremely pleased that the federal government , along with the Business Development Bank of Canada , initiated a $ 500 million lending pool to help accelerate development in private sector , four season type resort areas . 
we have a scenic geography that is second to none . 
we have , and will continue to develop biking , hiking and cross country trails that go on for hundreds of kilometres . 
we have the largest downhill ski area in Ontario , the friendliest and best run in North America . 
i encourage all my colleagues , both sides , and extend an invitation to visit and see our great riding . 
i extend that same invitation to industry . 
we want them too , and we need them . 
my riding , like many other rural ridings , has been continually losing its most cherished asset to larger urban centres . 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
this is a great honour , therefore , and your friends and family , the members of your party and certainly those who elected you will be very proud of you . 
i would also like to thank the new member for Simcoe - Grey . 
i listened closely to his speech and I feel he will make a good MP - or at least I hope so . 
he strikes me as being full of good will . 
he gave particular attention in his speech to agriculture and to unemployment . 
my riding seems rather like Simcoe - Grey , with a number of farmers and many unemployed people . 
i would like to ask the valiant new member for Simcoe - Grey , who states his readiness to work with all members of this House , what concrete proposals he wishes to make to his Liberal caucus that will be of any help whatsoever to the agricultural sector , which has seen its net earning power weaken year after year , particularly since 1993 when his party came to power , and to our young people in particular , with their abnormally high rate of unemployment ? 
and worse still - my final point - the duration of employment insurance benefits has been shortened . 
since the hon. member for Simcoe - Grey gives me the impression of being very very positive in these , his first days in the House of Commons , what are the concrete proposals he will make to his party caucus , to the Liberal party ? 
Mr. Paul Bonwick : 
Mr. Speaker , I question how well the hon. member listened . 
that is not just offering employment opportunities , it is also offering training opportunities to provide youth with a better lifestyle down the road . 
in so far as the agriculture community is concerned , one of the things that I have done in my riding , and I have certainly been vocal in caucus as well , is to open up lines of communication . 
the member seems to have his facts in error . 
there has been an increase in the last two years in farming income , certainly in our area . 
with respect to opening lines of communication , I have over the summer had the opportunity to have the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food travel to our riding and meet with the farmers , the brokers , the average people out there ; not just their OFA representatives , but the actual farmers . 
i have taken the time this summer to travel throughout the riding and sit in on the Grey County Federation of Agriculture and the Simcoe County Federation of Agriculture meetings . 
i bring that communication back to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food and I tell him how it has impacted . 
i am certainly a pipeline to this caucus and to this government on behalf of the farming community in my riding . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to indicate that I will be sharing our speaking slot with my hon. colleague from Winnipeg North Centre . 
i join with my parliamentary colleagues to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your ascension to the Chair . 
i look forward to seeing not only your smiling face but also your good judgment exercised during the next number of months . 
it states : 
while there are no easy solutions to the great problems facing our great country , there is a new will among Canadians to make a fresh start in the search for answers . 
there is that phrase " fresh start '' . 
it goes on to state : 
- a priority goal of my Ministers will be to breathe a new spirit into federalism and restore the faith and trust of all Canadians in the effectiveness of our system of government . 
a constant process of consultation and co - operation must be restored . 
my Ministers are regularly meeting their provincial colleagues to eliminate irritants and to improve services to people where the federal and provincial governments have joint responsibilities . 
this throne speech goes on to state : 
the process of consensus - building will engage the private sector partners in an era of co - operation on economic goals . 
in such a context , government would act as a guide , a mediator , a catalyst , becoming less intrusive in the private sector but vigilant over the integrity of the national economy and of national standards - . The 
my government will enter into discussion with the provinces aimed at a comprehensive overhaul of our pension system - 
Canadians are deeply troubled by the incidence of crime , especially crimes of violence - 
it goes on and on . 
i am glad my Liberal colleagues here are applauding because this is the throne speech of Brian Mulroney . 
it sounds exactly the same . 
some hon. members : 
liberal , Tory , same old story . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
this is the same throne speech . 
they did not even bother to re - write it . 
it was a new governor general , that is all . 
this throne speech is worth nothing . 
this is absolute pap . 
Yap , yap , who cares ? 
this is pap . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order . 
while his point may have been one that he feels he should make in this way , I am sure he knows it is wrong to perhaps over - dramatize things by tearing up books and so on in the course of his speech . 
i would ask him to restrain himself . 
he may recall that in the last Parliament we had incidents of this kind and the Speaker intervened . 
i am reluctant to do so with such an experienced member , but I feel in the circumstances I should draw the rules to his attention . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
Mr. Speaker , I apologize . 
pap is pretty cheap . 
when I listened to the throne speech in the other place , I reflected back on the last number of years here . 
i go back to the Tories because it is basically the same group , only different faces . 
i remember as a kid having my mother read me a story by Robert Louis Stevenson , called The Wreckers where unscrupulous people on a desert island would light fires on the rocks at night to lure ships into thinking it was a harbour . 
the ships would smash on the rocks , people would loot the ships and the people on the wrecked ships would die . 
i wonder if they really know what they are doing to the people of Canada . 
there is a reference in the throne speech to the deficit war being won . 
i suspect that if we listen carefully we would hear the Liberals cheering , saying " We won the deficit war . 
yes , we were successful '' . 
if we were to acknowledge the heroes of the deficit war over the last number of years it would not be the Minister of Finance and our Liberal colleagues across the way or our previous Conservative friends in the House of Commons . 
the minute there is a surplus we should go back and start mending the safety net that has been ripped and torn apart by the Liberals and by the Conservatives before them . 
this should be a top priority if we are a caring and decent country . 
i do not think this is funny . 
they are laughing at over a million children waking up this morning and living in poverty in the richest country in the world . 
i acknowledge that luxury car sales are up . 
i acknowledge that the Toronto Stock Exchange is at historic levels . 
i admit that corporate profits have never been higher and the banks are happier than they ever have been in our banking history . 
at the same time increasing numbers of Canadians are living in poverty , increasing numbers of people are losing their jobs , their businesses and their homes . 
what will the government do about this ? 
there must be some goodness left in this government . 
there must be something in here about what it will do about the 1.4 million people who do not have jobs today . 
is it mentioned ? 
i am being asked to talk about something new . 
the Liberals would love me to shut up about this topic . 
they would love me to stop talking about the 1.4 million people who are out of jobs ? 
they would love me to stop talking about the people in Atlantic Canada who met our caucus and said they have not worked in four years because of this government ' s policies on free trade , NAFTA and now the multilateral agreement on investment . 
there is a slow erosion in our country of what our parents and grandparents before them struggled to build for generation after generation into one of the best countries in the world . 
we have people by the hundreds of thousands lining up to come here because of what they built and what the government is tearing down systematically budget after budget after budget . 
this has to stop . 
we cannot sit here passively , talking about minor shifts in trade and changes to trade policy or tinkering and so on with various social programs . 
at the same time as we sit here today , the Minister of Finance has tabled legislation in the House to radically change the way seniors receive their pensions . 
when we cut through all the red tape and all those provisions , what does it say ? 
it says that hundreds of thousands of seniors in the future will receive fewer benefits . 
is that the kind of country we are ? 
is that what we have come to ? 
is there anything in this throne speech about a national child care system ? 
i heard minister after minister promise to introduce it . 
things must change . 
i am pleased to be here with a group of very progressive New Democrats who on a daily base in the House will remind the government how it has been cruel and continues to be cruel to many Canadians . 
that has to change and change soon . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. John Cannis ( Scarborough Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me congratulate you on your appointment . 
i was not surprised to hear the member from the NDP trying to draw a parallel between us and former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney . 
aside from his actions in tearing up his speech , he failed to draw to our attention that the Brian Mulroney and Conservative era left us with a humongous deficit of $ 42 billion that we inherited in 1993 . 
it is nice of them to say that we have to do this and we have to do that , but if we are adding debt and debt we will never be able to implement any of the programs such as the scholarship fund . 
unfortunately he was not listening . 
they all talk about doom and gloom . 
they do not want to talk about the good news that has been happening out there . 
they do not want to talk about the fact that in 1993 unemployment rates were 11.5 percent and today that are at 9 percent and dropping . 
we have to point out to the people that spending our way out of this is not the solution . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
was that a question , Mr. Speaker ? 
it was kind of a rant , I thought . 
my hon. friend is right . 
the government announced that it will do something to help students some day in the future . 
is this not nice ? 
in fact it was more precise . 
by the year 2000 it will take some action . 
if my friends opposite were sincere about helping young people afford post - secondary education , they would go far beyond having a scholarship program . 
they would consider doing away with tuition fees in our post - secondary institutions . 
i can hear my hon. friend now , that whining we hear all the time : " Where are they going to get the money ? " 
we always hear whining from across the way . 
this is not a new concept . 
it exists today . 
we will hear comments any day now - we should be hearing them in question period today - that the government has decided the Cadillac helicopter purchase has been changed into a Chevrolet and now we can afford it . 
we will be dishing out money now for the helicopters . 
fair enough . 
that is what this job is all about . 
helicopters will probably be a lot more important than helping poor children . 
buying helicopters will probably be a more important initiative than helping young people afford education . 
that is a decision that the government might well take . 
if it does , let us recognize that as long as it tolerates more than one million children living in poverty it will have to wear on its shoulders what the Conference of Catholic Bishops reminded us is a form of child abuse . 
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the compassion in the speech of the member for Kamloops as he talked about the people living at the poverty line , the unemployed and the seniors who are scraping to get buy . 
i have to ask the member for Kamloops , who is looking forward to his $ 1 million gold plated MPs pension , where his compassion was when he had the opportunity to say " No thanks . 
where was his compassion then , when he gets a pension five , six or seven times richer than the union members who have to work 30 years to get one - fifth of that ? 
where was his compassion ? 
the Reform Party gave $ 30 million back to the Canadian people by giving up their gold plated pensions . 
we did it because we care about Canadians . 
we care about the debt and we care about taxes . 
where is the compassion ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Charlotte on a point of order . 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Reform member is mentioning pensions . 
that is a ridiculous statement and is completely out of order . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i think the hon member will realize that was not a point of order . 
it was a matter of debate . 
does the hon. member for Kamloops wish to respond to the comment made by the hon. member Prince George - Bulkley Valley . 
if so , I will give him a moment . 
the five minute questions and comments period has expired so I would ask him to be brief . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be very brief . 
my hon. friend asked about the MPs ' pension . 
perhaps the best thing he could do would be to ask his own members of the Reform Party to take their pensions . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I begin my first speech in this assembly of democracy feeling a tremendous sense of responsibility given to me by the people in my constituency of Winnipeg North Centre , a constituency which is recognized right across this country as a symbol , as an example of the struggle for dignity , equality and justice in society today . 
they have given me a responsibility to fight for things that matter most to people , the things that were missing in the Speech from the Throne , the most important issues that affect people on a day to day basis : the matter of jobs , the matter of quality health care , the matter of good public education , the matter of hope for our young people , the matter of security for working families and the matter of dignity for our seniors . 
all of us in the NDP caucus feel the sense of responsibility people have entrusted in us . 
we will keep our promise . 
we will not break our commitment to raise those issues day in and day out . 
we will work as we have never worked before to ensure that their voices are heard in this Chamber . 
when I was elected I asked my eight year old son what I should say and do . 
he said " Tell everyone that we will make Ottawa rock '' . 
that is exactly what we intend to do day in and day out in this Chamber . 
we are here on behalf of people everywhere saying the rhetoric that ran as thick as syrup in the Speech from the Throne will not end the despair of people living without work or living with the daily fear of losing the job they may now hold . 
it will not relieve the stress on families trying to juggle several jobs , the responsibilities they have for the care of their children and the obligation they feel for their communities and their involvement in community life . 
it will not end the pain and suffering women feel on a day to day basis because they have to live with the threat of violence . 
my sense of responsibility , as I make my first speech in the House of Commons , also comes from those who came before me , those who made a difference in the lives of people in my constituency and indeed everywhere in this country . 
i am very fortunate to claim both Stanley Knowles and David Orlikow as my predecessors , two longstanding parliamentarians who made a real difference . 
who among us would not be familiar with the dogged persistence of David Orlikow who , for 26 years in this House , fought day in and day out for individuals and for policies that would improve people ' s lives and ensure some measure of dignity , security and equality among all people of all regions of the country ? 
i am proud to carry on his work . 
i am grateful for his contribution to Canada and I look forward to his ongoing help and advice . 
as my leader said yesterday , I also register a great deal of sadness at not being able to enter this Chamber and see my old friend and colleague , Stanley Knowles , sitting at the table . 
it was a dream I had . 
unfortunately it just was not to be . 
all of the issues and policies he fought so hard to achieve are now under attack by the Liberal government today . 
Canadians can be sure that we will fight to preserve a public pension system to stop the erosion of security for seniors in their old age . 
we will be there day in and day out . 
and we will try to do it as Stanley Knowles would have done it , with honour and dignity and integrity . 
Mr. Speaker , you can be sure that I will be raising many issues in this House but I will take my critic areas very seriously . 
having been here for the past few days , having heard the Speech from the Throne , are we any further ahead today under this government , or is this government just more subtle about its practice of continuing inequality and discrimination in our society today ? 
is it not the case that the privatization and deregulation and off - loading and cutback policies of this government are contributing to hardship and pain and suffering and greater inequalities facing women in our society today ? 
if women ' s equality is important would it not be the case that this government would have long ago honoured its obligations under the human rights act to ensure that women in the federal public service were paid on the basis of equality ? 
would it not be the case that instead of offering women half a loaf , this government would have said that before it considers spending $ 12.2 million on bonuses for senior civil servants , it will ensure it meets its obligations and ensures equal pay for work of equal value ? 
Mr. Speaker , you can also be sure that I will be raising , as much as possible , issues pertaining to health care . 
let us remember that this government in 1993 introduced the most regressive social policy in the history of this country , the Canada health and social transfer , and took the single biggest bite out of health care in the history of medicare . 
for many of us it was absolutely galling to read the Speech from the Throne and the statement " we will legislate to put back , to increase funds for the Canada health care system to the tune of $ 12.5 billion '' . 
we now are at the base floor of $ 12.5 billion . 
this government owes it to the people of Canada and to the future of medicare to ensure that our cash transfer payments for health care reflect the needs of health care , ensure that we are able to meet our obligations and that every Canadian is able to gain access to the best quality care in this country by virtue of being a member of a civilized country . 
deception , absolutely , because in fact the Speech from the Throne did also not mention that under the present formula of this government dollars from the federal government to provincial governments will actually decline in real terms . 
it does not look at the growth in the economy . 
it does not consider growth in population . 
we will see in real dollar terms a continual drop in funding from this government to the provinces , thereby jeopardizing even further the future of medicare in this country . 
there are so many more issues to raise and so little time . 
i want to acknowledge the challenges we all face . 
i and many of my colleagues in this caucus are trying to juggle our work as a members of Parliament and also our responsibility to our children . 
many of us have young children . 
we are grateful for their support and we recognize that we are not unique . 
we represent many families , many women in this country trying to juggle so much because of the inaction and the lack of attention of this government to those very important issues . 
in the name of Stanley Knowles and others who have fought so hard for these issues , we will be as vigilant as possible to ensure that every person in this country is able to live with security , dignity and hope for the future . 
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the member for Winnipeg North Centre for her maiden remarks in the House of Commons . 
in my riding 50 p . cent of the people who voted for me are New Democrats . 
it is not a question of us being ideologically different . 
in this Parliament we must not throw ideas out in a general sense . 
for example , the member for Kamloops came up with the idea of cancelling tuition for post - secondary education . 
it is an interesting idea but I do not think we can table an idea like that on the floor of the House of Commons unless we can link some dollars to it . 
if our ideas are going to have credibility I share the member ' s son ' s view that we should try to make this place rock . 
we really should . 
this place is a stiff , dull place at the best of times . 
if we are really going to have credibility we need to have numbers attached to some of these ideas . 
it is only through that approach that we will have a reasonable chance of getting some of these ideas into a debate with some credibility attached . 
i would like to ask the member a specific question . 
does she think it is a reasonable request for when New Democrats throw a specific idea on the floor ? 
for example , I do not believe Bob Rae or Roy Romanow really wanted to close 100 hospitals over 18 months . 
i believe they had a fiscal dilemma on their hands . 
they are both good people . 
when we come back with ideas on how to correct it , I really think numbers should be attached . 
if the notion of forgetting about the fiscal framework of this country creeps back in , then we will have higher interest rates which will hurt us when we are trying to get jobs going . 
could the member please respond to that ? 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis : 
Mr. Speaker , if the member is wondering at all why some provinces are trying to do the best they can in terms of limited health care resources , he should start asking his own Minister of Health how we can revamp the transfer payment system so that provinces are not squeezed . 
he should consider the fact that if we take $ 6.8 billion out of the health care system , we will be left with enormous pressures on provincial governments , on other organizations and on families . 
it is absolutely critical that we all work together to reverse that trend . 
i look forward to help from the member in convincing the ministers of health and finance that we need to start increasing transfer payments . 
it may not be overnight that we get it back up to the $ 19 billion it was when they took office but certainly we could start today to reverse that so people are not forced into a difficult decision . 
the question was how much . 
we have been very specific on this issue and every other issue . 
we have said let us work now to increase the transfer payments to provinces at least to $ 15 billion . 
the member asked for specifics . 
give me 24 hours and I could fill that time with the specifics we have suggested . 
let me make two very quick references . 
in the whole area of health care and caring for seniors and children we have said over and over again that if the government would only look at it as something which is an important social investment and a job creation tool , we would be a lot better off in this country . 
there are thousands of jobs to be created if the government would just realize that it has a responsibility to ensure that there is a measure of quality care for everyone . 
Mr. Dennis J . Mills : 
and the source of funding ? 
Ms. Wasylycia - Leis : 
if the member would give me another few hours I could certainly list a variety of measures , especially under the taxation system to deal with precisely that question . 
that would not be a cost because it would pay for itself in a short time . 
there are dozens and dozens of ideas . 
we will keep bringing them forward in the House . 
i look forward to the member ' s supporting our proposals . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too would like to offer either my congratulations or my condolences to you . 
i think your job is going to be interesting over the next four or five years . 
i wish you well and I look forward to it . 
i will be sharing my time with the member for Waterloo - Wellington who will speak after me . 
i would like to begin by paying tribute to my predecessors who have represented Mississauga West . 
fortunately for me it has done so once again . 
specifically I would like to thank the voters of Mississauga West for their confidence in sending me to Ottawa to represent them in this place . 
Mississauga West is an interesting riding made up of three very distinct communities , Streetsville , Erin Mills and Meadowvale . 
the perception of the riding is really different than the reality , as is probably true of many ridings . 
the perception is that it is a riding with high average incomes . 
in addition we have our share of concerns and problems . 
i frankly take exception to a member of the House standing in his place and saying that because we are Liberals in the government we do not care about people . 
that is absolute nonsense . 
it is stuff that I have listened to for five years in opposition to the NDP in the parliament of Ontario . 
it is interesting that is almost d é ja vu in this place . 
we care about social housing problems . 
we need more in my riding . 
i was the president of the Peel non - profit housing while a member of Peel regional council . 
i was on that board for nine years . 
we have women ' s shelters and a food bank . 
we want to end the systemic violence against women and children , and no individual or political party in the House has cornered those concepts and ideas . 
we have youth unemployment and under employment . 
i have three sons in their 20 s and I am concerned about their future the same as all parents care about the future of their children . 
we have new Canadians , refugees who need help to adjust . 
we have crime . 
we need to fight crime to take back our streets . 
we in the Liberal Party believe that we can do all of those things by providing a balance . 
we hear calls to spend more from the left . 
i sat and watched an NDP government in Ontario take the total debt of that province from $ 39 billion in 1990 to over $ 100 billion in 1995 , which literally destroyed the confidence of one of our greatest provinces . 
what I hear from the party of the left is to spend more . 
i watched what the Tories did . 
it was interesting to hear the sound bite this morning on the news of the leader of what I believe is the fifth party in this beautiful establishment , the leader of the Progressive Conservatives , who said that there was a sign over the Prime Minister ' s door which reads " send it and we will spend it '' . 
you send it and we will spend it again '' . 
that is the nonsense of getting into extremes . 
i find the official opposition to be rather interesting . 
it is the politics of Ross Perot . 
it uses analogies like Ross Perot would do when he says on television " If you want to know why the car won ' t run , you have to open up the hood and look at the engine '' . 
i heard the Leader of the Opposition say that they have fixed one of the flat tires on the car . 
i heard the speaker from the Reform Party this morning go through some incredible analogy about a ship at sea going down the Niagara River . 
he lost most Canadians and most people in the House before he got on board the particular ship . 
an hon. member : 
he failed geography . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
our plan is a balanced plan . 
we said clearly and loudly during the election that when we achieve a surplus , 50 percent of that surplus will go to the kind of social spending that the NDP talks about and for tax relief , and 50 p . cent will go toward debt reduction . 
it is a balanced plan that we believe the people of Canada believe in . 
clearly they have sent us here to administer that plan and to deliver it . 
i would ask my hon. friends in the third party to remember that Canada is a unique and wonderful country . 
from coast to coast , our country embraces many regions , each different in its own way , including the very unique province of Quebec . 
throughout our long history , we have learned to set our differences aside and work together to build a great country . 
a great and vigorous country where democracy flourishes , without sacrificing minority rights , a country where citizens can move freely , a country where everyone can speak freely without fear of persecution , a country that is the envy of the world . 
i believe all Canadians are prepared to reconcile their differences and continue building their country . 
recent surveys show that the vast majority of Quebecers want to stay in Canada . 
Quebecers want to be a part of this great country . 
i would urge hon. members of the third party to respect the will of the majority of Quebecers as expressed in two referendums and numerous surveys , and give up their plans to destroy this unparalleled success . 
i suggest they join us to continue building this country . 
we want Quebec to stay in Canada and help build this wonderful country . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I was very interested to hear what the hon. member from the Liberal Party had to say . 
in particular , in spite of his pronunciation , I appreciated the few words he said in French . 
and he referred to Quebec as a very unique province . 
this qualifier adds to the uniqueness . 
he said that Canada and Quebec should work together . 
he also referred to two referendums . 
what I would like - 
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I just wanted to inquire - and I believe this is a point of order - whether it is customary for an official opposition member who is standing to receive the first question following a debate or whether it is up to the Speaker ' s discretion . 
could you clarify that for me ? 
i was standing in my place . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i saw the hon. member . 
there were two members who rose . 
i am choosing a round as best I can in exercising discretion . 
i do not think it is normal that necessarily the official opposition gets the first question on a government member ' s question . 
what is normal is that an opposition member gets it . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye : 
Mr. Speaker , I acknowledge and appreciate your customary wisdom . 
i also want to thank my other colleagues for their smiles and moral support . 
as I was saying , our Liberal Party colleague referred earlier to the two referendums which were held . 
i may remind him , however , that on both occasions , promises were made to the people of Quebec , and in both cases , these promises were not kept . 
i would like to ask the hon. member of the Liberal Party two questions , and I would appreciate an answer . 
he wants Quebec and Canada to work together . 
does the hon. member opposite acknowledge the existence of the people of Quebec ? To work together , we must first be who we are . 
if we are , we can work together in a partnership , something we have offered to do since we came to this House . 
i am waiting for his answer . 
if he is consistent in what he says , his answer will be a resounding yes . 
i will now listen to what he has to say . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
Mr. Speaker , it is helpful for the member to ask the question and then tell me what I should answer . 
i appreciate the fact that the two parties are fighting over an opportunity to respond to some of my comments . 
let me say very directly to the member opposite that I certainly - and I believe my government - recognize the province of Quebec as a partner within Confederation . 
we recognize it as a unique society . 
i personally recognize it as quite distinct . 
when we look at language , when we look at law , when we look at culture , there is every reason for the country to embrace the province of Quebec as a distinct society or a unique society , whatever word we want to put on it . 
i was in fact cautioned before I made my somewhat embarrassing attempt at French . 
the reason I was doing it was that hopefully within a year or so I will be a little more proficient and able to address answers to the member in the French language . 
i was also told that I probably should not waste my time trying to convert the Bloc Quebecois . 
i can see that is obvious . 
you have one goal and one goal only and that is to destroy this country . 
frankly that is not what - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order , please . 
i do not wish to interrupt the hon. member but he must address his remarks to the Chair . 
i invite him to do so and he may continue his answer . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
Mr. Speaker , the party opposite has a clear - cut goal . 
having said that , I think it is important for those of us from English Canada , from communities like Mississauga which by the way is designated as officially bilingual because of the francophone community we have there , to say that we do not want the polarization that party seeks . 
we want Canada to be strong . 
we realize that in order to be strong we have to deal with the issue of separation and national unity . 
we have to send a message from sea to sea to sea which says we are united , that Quebec is a part of Canada . 
a vast majority of the people , at least a clear majority of the people in the province of Quebec , has recently stated they are tired of this issue . 
they are more concerned about the economy and they want to get on with building this great nation . 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment as a Speaker of this great House . 
it is an honour for you and deserving of both you and this great institution . 
i represent the riding of Waterloo - Wellington , one of the four new ridings in Ontario and one of four new ridings in all of Canada . 
i am exceedingly proud , honoured and humbled to represent this great riding . 
i am immensely grateful to my constituents for electing me to this 36 th Parliament . 
i will undertake to serve my constituents to the very best of my ability and talent . 
Waterloo - Wellington captures the essence of Canada . 
Elora , Fergus , Jacobs , Elmira , Baden , New Hamburg , Harrison and Palmerston . 
it contains a number of smaller towns and villages including St. Agatha , New Dundee , Wellesley , Drayton , Clifford , Belwood , Conestogo , Maryhill and Breslau . 
it contains that famous place called Punky Doodle ' s Corner . 
Waterloo - Wellington is a rich and diverse riding of urban , rural and suburban people . 
it contains people from all walks of life and from all backgrounds . 
approximately 30 percent of the wealth of the riding is generated as a result of agriculture and agribusiness . 
farming is important to our part of Ontario . 
i was born , raised and still live on the family farm . 
in fact the highest number and concentration of old order Mennonites and Amish people in all of Canada reside in my riding . 
canada will march confidently into the 21 st century and the new millennium . 
we have a plan and a vision which will enable Canada to be the very best in every way for its citizens . 
the foundation of that plan is to balance the books . 
it is gratifying to hear that the deficit will effectively be eliminated in the next fiscal year . 
the trouble with doing something right the first time in over 30 years is that no one really appreciates how difficult it was to get there , but I believe Canadians do appreciate the enormity of the sacrifice to bring the deficit from $ 42 billion in 1993 down to zero in the next fiscal year . 
i believe Canadians appreciate that the many years of sacrifice will pay off in the end , and that end is soon . 
once we are in the surplus situation , the formula as has been noted is an easy one to understand . 
one - half will support the programs Canadians want and deserve and the other half will go toward debt reduction and tax reduction . 
with this game plan Canada is poised to lead the industrialized world in economic growth this year and next and beyond . 
our plan provides us with the fiscal stability necessary to allow change to be accommodated effectively and efficiently . 
jobs are being created at a remarkable pace but we need to do more . 
unemployment , especially youth unemployment , is at an unacceptable level . 
we need to look at establishing a national apprenticeship style program for our young people , recognizing there are provincial implications , but co - operation would be the key here . 
it would be an apprenticeship program that would marry the needs of society with the aspirations of our young people . 
it would assist the private sector to meet its labour requirements and ensure that young people would have the opportunity to acquire that important first job . 
as a former teacher I can say that a hungry child is much more likely to be a problem learner with poor school performance . 
a hungry child is much more likely to be a behavioural problem . 
children with learning and behavioural problems are much more likely to become drop - outs from school and from society . 
as the former chairman of the Waterloo regional police I can also say that drop - outs from school and society often fall into the trap of crime and become young offenders . 
the social and economic impacts of youth crime are unacceptable to Canadians . 
they are demanding that we act proactively to attack the roots of crime . 
in a country as wealthy as Canada with its physical and human resources , I find it unacceptable that even one child would go hungry . 
i believe that we as a caring society and a caring nation need to put in place a program to eradicate child hunger . 
investments in that regard made today will pay enormous dividends tomorrow . 
we owe our children regardless of the status of their families the opportunity to learn , to grow and to become valued citizens without the burden of hunger . 
attacking child hunger and the roots of youth crime must therefore be a priority of this government in its attack on child poverty . 
i personally look forward to voicing the views of my constituents in this great Parliament , and like all good parliamentarians I will listen more and judge less . 
i look forward to working together with my colleagues for the betterment of Canada . 
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the hon. member from the Liberal Party talk about how the Liberal Party should be getting a lot of praise and pats on the back for finally doing something right after the last 30 years . 
let us look at what the Liberals have done right . 
what they have been practising for 30 years along with their friends in the Tory party and their friends in the NDP is more effective ways of wrenching dollars out of the taxpayers ' pockets . 
they not only got it right during the 35 th Parliament , but they have perfected it . 
they have wrenched an extra $ 25 billion out of the pockets of Canadian businesses and Canadian workers by raising taxes in more than 36 different areas . 
they got it right all right , but let us not let them take any praise for it because the Canadian taxpayers are the ones who had to bear the brunt of that tax torture . 
i am certain that the member has read the throne speech and he has a good handle on the economic numbers , better than the finance minister had yesterday . 
i would like to ask the member the question the finance minister could not answer . 
when exactly can we expect the first surplus after the balanced budget , and exactly according to the Liberal numbers , how much is that surplus going to be ? 
when and how much ? 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
Mr. Speaker , to the hon. member opposite , I would not presuppose and begin to answer for the finance minister . 
i would however say that it seems to me that the Reform Party just does not get it . 
there is importance in getting our fiscal house in order . 
we as a government have been able to do that over the past number of years not only effectively but efficiently . 
that speaks volumes about the ability of the government to take a terrible financial situation and put in place the kinds of safeguards that will ensure prosperity not only for this generation but for generations to come . 
it seems to me that that groundwork now having been laid will ensure that prosperity will flow and we can then all share fully in that surplus position . 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speake , before making my comments to the member for Waterloo - Wellington , I would like to congratulate you on being returned to your duties as Deputy Speaker of this House . 
you certainly deserve it , having proven your mettle in the 35 th Parliament , and I trust you will be just as vigilant in the 36 th . 
i would address my remarks to the member for Waterloo - Wellington , an educator it seems . 
i understand that he cares a great deal about young Canadians and especially the young people in his riding . 
does he consider the abnormally high rate of unemployment among young people to be normal ? 
the rate of unemployment among young people increased . 
is it the member ' s intention to propose concrete solutions to his Liberal caucus for improving things for our young people , to enable them to find satisfying work that complements their studies at CEGEP or university ? 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
Mr. Speaker , in reply to the hon. member opposite , I would simply say that any rate of unemployment is not normal . 
we will have to , as will people from all parts of Canada and members on all sides of the House , work to ensure that the kind of unemployment which we have now is brought down to an effective and appropriate level . 
i would say to him that we need to continue to work very hard to ensure that is the case . 
we will press not only government but also caucus members to do that to ensure that the best kinds of jobs will be in place for Canadians . 
the Speaker : 
debate . 
of course I am going to recognize the hon. member for Charlotte . 
however I was wondering , instead of having you begin and then interrupting your remarks for question period , if you would begin your remarks when the debate reconvenes . 
would that be acceptable to you ? 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , that would be more than acceptable . 
the Speaker : 
my colleagues , as it is nearly 2 p.m. , perhaps we could begin with members ' statements . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
royal CANADIAN LEGION 
Mr. Jerry Pickard ( Kent - Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this week is Legion Week here in Ontario . 
we as Canadians owe a great deal to the men and women of the Royal Canadian Legion who in many cases have devoted their lives to the remembrance of their fallen comrades as well as those who have made major sacrifices for the defence of our country . 
legion members across this land take up the torch daily to enhance the lives of seniors , youth , veterans and the disabled . 
last year alone $ 310 million were raised and spent in communities across this country while three million hours of work were put in by volunteers and members of this great organization . 
may I express the thanks of millions of Canadians for the great work and dedication given to us by the Royal Canadian Legion members . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a little fish story for the House today . 
a bunch of the good old boys , like Turbot Tobin and Walleye Woodward , were out with their chum the Federal Fisherman . 
what a time ; no worries , no cares , just them and those Labrador sport fish . 
it was very educational for the Federal Fisherman . 
during his time there he almost learned the difference between the salmon and a sucker . 
i am sure the member for Burin - St. 
George ' s urges the Federal Fisherman to make this an annual event so that every July he spends his hard - earned dollars in Labrador . 
and just like this July , the minister can celebrate his return by flying over Prince Rupert and the salt water fishermen far below . 
is it not wonderful that the Prime Minister does not subtract days spent fishing in Labrador from a minister ' s shelf life . 
* * * 
arts AND CULTURE 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Fergus , Ontario is located in my riding . 
Fergus among other things is noted for its architectural beauty which is surpassed only by its natural beauty located as it is on the Grand River watershed . 
Fergus is also famous as the home of the Fergus Scottish Highland Games . 
recently an opportunity has arisen for the purchase and renovation of the Fergus building that houses the Grand Theatre , which a number of theatre groups call home . 
a fundraising campaign has started and is called " the crowning touch to restore the downtown jewel '' . 
needless to say , I support this very worthwhile effort . 
the initiative in Fergus underscores the necessity for Canadians wherever they live to support cultural and community endeavours such as this . 
the preservation , promotion and expansion of Canadian culture in all its many forms is both necessary and desirable . 
i applaud all of those who , like the residents in Fergus , are doing something to support our culture . 
* * * 
centre DES FEMMES DE LAVAL 
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I take special pleasure today in paying tribute to the Centre des femmes de Laval , which is celebrating 15 years of operation . 
the centre , whose main goal is to improve living conditions for women , provides shelter , counselling , information and support to all women in Laval . 
be it through information and training or through innovative programs , the Centre des femmes de Laval brings women together to discuss their individual situations , look for solutions and , more importantly , break down the isolation women often unwillingly find themselves in . 
as a founding member of the centre , I want to congratulate the board of directors , the staff and especially the volunteers who work in this key player in the Laval community . 
long live the Centre des femmes ! 
* * * 
royal VICTORIA HOSPITAL 
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise in the House for the first time in my new career as a federal politician to congratulate the citizens of my riding of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford for their magnificent community spirit and fund - raising efforts which have resulted in the development of the new Royal Victoria Hospital . 
i was honoured to participate on September 13 with the Lieutenant - Governor and the minister of health for Ontario as we celebrated together this splendid new facility . 
it was truly a happy occasion . 
the 297 bed facility will be the regional hospital for all of Simcoe County and beyond . 
it is the result of the impressive Building on a Century campaign which saw the community raise $ 15 million toward its construction . 
the new hospital features over $ 25 million in state of the art equipment and will be the location of Ontario ' s newest breast screening site . 
* * * 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , 25 years ago this week Dr. Tom Bolton discovered the first evidence of black holes while working at the David Dunlap Observatory , University of Toronto , located in Richmond Hill . 
a black hole is a collapsed star of such mass and density that nothing can escape from it , not even light . 
there had long been speculation that black holes existed , but Dr. Bolton produced the first credible evidence . 
this is an event of great importance , not only to my riding of Oak Ridges , but also to Canada . 
we are in the forefront of great scientific discoveries , working with the largest telescope in Canada . 
the University of Toronto boasts one of the world ' s greatest programs in astrophysics and with continued support , not only from the federal government but also from committed private supporters , I am sure we can look forward to maintaining Canada ' s leading edge discoveries and contributions to international space exploration . 
i congratulate Dr. Bolton . 
* * * 
prostate CANCER 
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among Canadian men , with an estimated 80 men being diagnosed every working day . 
its incidence is 40 percent greater than that of breast cancer and only lung cancer kills more men than does prostate cancer . 
prostate cancer , because it strikes one man in eight , is , like breast cancer , a serious disease which affects huge numbers of Canadian families . 
yet prostate cancer , which kills 4,000 men each year , was ignored in the government ' s throne speech . 
it continues to receive just one - ninth of the funding of breast cancer research and one - fiftieth of the research money given to AIDS . 
we owe it to ourselves , our families and our constituents . 
* * * 
CAPE PROJECT 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have reason to be proud of Canada ' s youth . 
on September 19 , the Canadian Space Agency in St. Hubert hosted an event involving the elementary and high school students taking part in the CAPE project . 
this project is aimed at sending experimental equipment primarily designed for protein crystallization to the MIR station . 
the experiments were developed by young students from across the country in co - operation with their teachers and with scientists who may be their colleagues 15 years from now . 
as the member representing the Minister of Industry at this event and a teacher by profession , I have seen for myself that we need not worry about the next generation of Canadian scientists . 
our government is investing in such programs as CAPE to ensure that more students have better opportunities in finding jobs and more opportunities to learn the skills that they will need in building Canada ' s future . 
i hope the experiments leaving for MIR today , which testify to the inquisitiveness and ingenuity of Canadian youth , will be an unqualified success . 
* * * 
world MARITIME WEEK 
Mr. Antoine Dub é ( L é vis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this week we are celebrating World Maritime Week and I want to take this opportunity to draw to the attention of all members the future of the L é vis shipyard . 
i would have preferred to talk about good news this week . 
unfortunately , the government ' s lack of action in the shipbuilding sector is just as bad as it was during the Liberals ' first mandate . 
indeed , Davie Industries executives have been waiting for months for a positive reply to a request for financial security from the Export Development Corporation , in order to execute a $ 125 - million contract with Petrobras , a Brazilian crown corporation . 
the refitting of the Spirit of Columbus platform would immediately create 400 jobs . 
we are also still waiting for the implementation of a true shipbuilding policy , as promised by the Liberals four years ago . 
let us hope that World Maritime Week will be a wake - up call for the Liberal government . 
* * * 
throne SPEECH 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the member for Laval West , I want to congratulate the government on its Speech from the Throne to open the first session of the 36 th Parliament of Canada in which it set out its priorities for the years ahead . 
of particular note is its wish to maintain national unity . 
our government should be congratulated on its clearly stated intention to contribute to the effort by federal , provincial and territorial governments to develop a more collaborative approach to strengthening and modernizing Canada ' s social union . 
in order to build a stronger Canada , our government will invest in children , in quality care and good health , and will take steps to ensure the safety of our communities . 
these are some of the goals that we believe will help bring all Canadians closer together as we head into the next millennium . 
* * * 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to convey to you and to this House that it is a great honour to represent Vancouver Kingsway in this Parliament . 
one of the most important strengths of Vancouver Kingsway is its cultural diversity . 
as the first Asian Canadian woman to be elected to Parliament , I am proud to be their voice here in Ottawa and to champion their diversity . 
* * * 
BRITISH COLUMBIA 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today we read of the sad and unfortunate conclusions of a one - time prominent Conservative senator who , having spent a lifetime trying to change the federation from within , is now reduced to bitter mumblings about B.C. ' s separation from Canada . 
what went wrong ? 
perhaps it started with the Liberals and the national energy program , an arrogant , me first initiative that gouged the west and catered to the east . 
perhaps the fault lies with the Conservative leader , the leader of her own party who , bereft of ideas for Canada , clings desperately to the distinct society clause as a solution to national unity . 
first it was a report from the B.C. adviser on national unity warning of the potential of western separation . 
now a prominent senator has turned her back on her own party , its leader and the centrist ideas for which it stands . 
it is time to listen up , Mr. Prime Minister . 
if he continues to ignore the concerns of western Canada , if he refuses to recognize Canada as a federation of equal provinces and citizens , if he continues to ignore the pleadings for parliamentary and Senate reform , he will have sown the wind only to reap the whirlwind . 
* * * 
the LATE DUDLEY GEORGE 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday I attended an event marking a tragic day in our country ' s history . 
two years ago Dudley George was shot dead . 
he was one of 40 people peacefully protesting at Ipperwash . 
these unarmed citizens ended up facing the Ontario Provincial Police riot squad and the tactical weapons squad . 
the responsibility for this anti - native act lies with the current Ontario government . 
just two days ago the government in the throne speech committed itself to " develop relationships with aboriginal peoples based on the principles of partnership , transparency , predictability and accountability '' . 
transparency and accountability , enough words . 
i call on the government to support the call for a full public inquiry in Ontario . 
each day that passes without a full public inquiry into Ipperwash darkens the stain of the blood spilled at that tragic event . 
* * * 
osteoporosis 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , studies show that elderly people can minimize the loss of bone that may lead to osteoporosis , a debilitating bone disease that affects thousands of Canadian seniors by consuming the higher amount of calcium and vitamin D now recommended by the Osteoporosis Society of Canada . 
i urge people over 50 in my riding of Brampton Centre and throughout Canada to add at least one extra serving of dairy products to their daily menu to help keep their bones and teeth strong . 
we can all contribute to improving our own chances for wellness and reduce the future cost for medicare by making the right choices now . 
* * * 
income TAXES 
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , taxes are too high . 
while progress has been made in lowering the deficit , it has come at the expense of jobs and higher taxes . 
if Canadians experience increases in their incomes , personal income taxes , EI and CPP premiums reduce those incomes by two - thirds . 
taxes in Canada from all levels of government account for more than one - third of the GDP . 
CPP hikes proposed by this government with current EI premiums will further burden already over taxed Canadians . 
clearly lower taxes mean both economic and employment growth . 
as a nation that depends on bilateral trade with the United States , the widening tax gap between the two countries continues to damage our standard of living . 
if the government is serious about jobs for all Canadians in this new economy , it must now get serious about tax cuts and lower EI premiums as Canadians have earned this right . 
we are the only political party that is advocating tax cuts now . 
the Speaker : 
yesterday I shared with you my intention , with your help of course , to make question period a little more brisk , if you will . 
i want to thank all of the interveners yesterday , those who put the questions and those who gave the answers . 
i especially want to thank the Prime Minister who pointed out that he understood that I would be intervening when a certain amount of time went by . 
today I am going to try to tighten it up just a little bit more so that we get in both the question and the answer in 35 seconds and I know that we are all going to co - operate . 
with that I am going to recognize the hon. Leader of the Opposition . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
the DEBT 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in 1992 the Mulroney government passed the debt servicing and reduction act . 
it established a special account to pay down the debt from a special surplus . 
of course , Mulroney continued to spend so there was neither a surplus nor any debt reduction . 
the whole thing was a shell game . 
now this prime minister promises to put 50 percent of any surplus into a special fund and to pay down the debt and give tax relief from that account while continuing to spend at record levels . 
my question for the prime minister is how is his shell game any different from Mulroney ' s shell game ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the difference is that during Mr. Mulroney ' s time he moved the deficit up to $ 42 billion . 
we are reducing it to zero . 
that is a very big difference . 
according to the Speech from the Throne it will be done in the next year . 
we are not there yet . 
it is amazing the satisfaction I am getting today standing in the House seeing the Leader of Opposition very preoccupied with the fact that we have been very successful in what we did with the finances of the nation . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , anybody could have done better than the federal Tories in reducing the deficit . 
what the prime minister failed to mention is that the national debt is $ 82 billion higher than it was under Mulroney . 
what he fails to mention is that his government is ripping $ 3,000 more from every average Canadian family in taxes than Mulroney did . 
and on top of that there are 1.4 million unemployed . 
if the prime minister is not playing a shell game , if he wants to make himself different from Mulroney , then why does he not pass the bulk of any surplus on to Canadian taxpayers ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if we reduce taxes we are not reducing the deficit . 
that is something people will understand . 
we said that in the end we will be in a position of surplus . 
it is coming but we are not there yet because there are still some problems in the nation . 
when I look at the program of the Leader of the Opposition , he promised to put $ 4 billion more into health care . 
he is a spender . 
right at the beginning of the campaign we said that next year the provinces would receive $ 700 million more and the year after $ 1.4 billion and the same thing in the years to come . 
so over the period of our term we will have given more back to medicare . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the prime minister has done it to health care . 
there are young families out there in which both parents are working and they cannot make ends meet because of high tax levels . 
there are businesses out there that would hire these younger workers we are all concerned about except that the government is charging excessive payroll taxes , and the throne speech did not promise a cent of tax relief to those families or those businesses . 
what it promised are 29 new spending proposals from the government . 
my question to the prime minister is who does he think would spend any surplus more wisely , Liberal politicians and bureaucrats or those families and businesses ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Leader of the Opposition wanted me to speak about equality of the provinces . 
that is exactly why I said yesterday that to make sure that everybody in Canada is equal we will put some of the money in the surplus to give a chance for students to go to university so they will be on an equal footing with the children of the rich people of Canada . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Reformers believe that any surpluses belong to Canadians and they are really demanding accountability . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is axiomatic and very clear that in every budget the government accounts for government spending . 
i can assure the hon. member that I will do that . 
there is another difference . 
i believe that the then minister of finance , Michael Wilson , wanted to cut the deficit but he did not get the support of his prime minister , and I did . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are glad to see that the finance minister is making up with the prime minister . 
that is wonderful . 
in 1993 the finance minister said no government can operate effectively when its projections fall consistently short of the mark . 
yet now even he refuses to set a mark . 
the Speaker : 
my colleague , I am having a bit of trouble with the phrase " a deliberate attempt to bamboozle '' . 
i want to caution the member to please choose his words judiciously . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if anybody is going to make up with anybody , perhaps the hon. member might make up with his leader whom he consigned to the scrap heap of history yesterday . 
let me be very clear . 
we are going to balance the budget in 1998 - 99 . 
there are going to be surpluses . 
we are going to be in a position to cut taxes . 
* * * 
CALGARY DECLARATION 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the Prime Minister made a very telling statement on the consultations to be held by the provinces on the Calgary declaration . 
the Prime Minister said that the federal government might consult Quebecers , going around the Government of Quebec and the National Assembly . 
i simply want to ask the Prime Minister whether he knows how the other provinces will consult their citizens on the Calgary declaration . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the provinces have used or will use all kinds of ways to consult their citizens , and I think the Canadian government has the right to consult Canadians throughout Canada . 
however , I did not say we would . 
some hon. members : 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien : 
no , that is not what I said . 
i said , in response to a question by the member who asked us to do so immediately , that I did not reject the idea . 
first we will see what the provinces that agreed to work on this will do , and then we will let you know . 
however , no one can deny the right of the Parliament of Canada to consult the voters who elect the members of this Parliament . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
but the Prime Minister did not specify what kind of means . 
how could he , in a major speech he made yesterday , lend such credibility to strategies as yet unknown , to consultations which may or may not be reliable ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , each provincial government will decide what form of consultation it will use . 
at this point , it seems obvious that each government will opt for different methods . 
there are many ways to consult the public . 
we think that we can consult the public if necessary . 
i never said we would do so , and we never determined what form this would take . 
we are perfectly happy to see the provinces select different methods to consult their citizens , and we hope that at some point they will adopt resolutions in their respective legislative assemblies , each province according to its own lights . 
as I said before , as soon as they have presented these resolutions , a similar resolution will be put before this House , and then we will discuss - 
the Speaker : 
i am sorry to interrupt the Right Hon. Prime Minister , but the hon. member for Temiscamingue has the floor . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister . 
the premier of Newfoundland has stated that his consultation on the Calgary declaration would be done via the Internet , a 1 - 800 line , or at riding meetings . 
does the Prime Minister , who claims to be so concerned about clarity and transparency , consider this method of consultation to be sufficient and satisfactory ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the premier of Newfoundland is the one answerable to the voters of Newfoundland , and it is up to him to defend his proposal . 
according to what I have read so far , he has the agreement of the opposition parties to do this . 
if he is making use of a modern method of consultation , that ' s fine . 
each province will have its own method of consultation . 
when the premier of Newfoundland faces his legislature , he will have to justify his consultation formula . 
it is not up to me to approve or disapprove of it , that is up to his legislature . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien : 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are very pleased to hear that it is not up to the Prime Minister to decide how the provinces are to conduct their business . 
at last . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. Pierre Brien : 
since the Prime Minister does not , when it comes down to it , know all that much about how Brian Tobin and his colleagues are going to hold their consultations on the Calgary declaration , how can he use that consultation , whose methodology he does not know , as a pretext , in a major speech , to make yet another threat against Quebec ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there is of course no connection . 
i believe the hon. member is saying that the procedure relating to a referendum on secession should only be determined by the secessionist government . 
the hon. member must realize that the consultation process carried out by the premier of Newfoundland has to do with a policy statement which has no constitutional impact and which only involves that particular province , for the time being . 
in the case of a secession , the territory of Quebec would be excluded from the Canadian legal order and from Canadian federal institutions , something which cannot be achieved through such a procedure . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the prime minister . 
our west coast salmon fishery is in dire straits . 
British Columbians , indeed all Canadians , are offended at the federal government ' s weak stance in this dispute . 
last week a congressional committee on the Pacific salmon treaty heard testimony in Washington from key stakeholders . 
members of this House deserve to know that Canada was invited to testify at those hearings . 
why did the prime minister fail to send representatives to testify at these hearings and to stand up for Canada ' s interests ? 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am disappointed that the hon. member , whose experience has been in a provincial legislature rather than in the national legislature , would not understand that in Canada , as in the United States , it is a decision of the committee itself as to who will appear before it . 
we have no more right to tell American committees who they will have before them than they have to tell our committees of this House who to have before them . 
i find it strange that the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party would believe in a principle that would allow other governments the right to attend all committee hearings of the House of Commons and Senate . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , no amount of wriggling and slithering on this issue is going to get the government off the hook . 
the minister of fisheries knows perfectly well that Canadians were invited to testify and they failed to testify . 
my question to the minister of fisheries is when is his government going to stand up for the interests of Canadian fishers in coastal communities ? 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think it is time for the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party to speak with the leader of the New Democratic Party in British Columbia . 
we have consistently had from the New Democratic Party of British Columbia rejection of the contacts with Americans that I have made , with every senator from Alaska , Washington state and Oregon , with representatives of the White House , representatives of the state department and the governors of Oregon , Washington and Alaska . 
they have said no to such contacts . 
is she following the policies of the New Democratic premier or is she announcing a different policy here ?

trade 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister . 
he is preparing another team Canada trip for January . 
when will the Prime Minister show the same enthusiasm of breaking down trade barriers within Canada as he shows for charting up air miles outside Canada ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when I travel abroad I travel with all the premiers of Canada who are always very delighted to travel on team Canada . 
the business community of Canada is lining up to be on the trip . 
in terms of trade barriers within Canada , the Minister of Industry has worked very hard with the provinces and the provinces have worked very hard among themselves to come close to an agreement . 
if the hon. member is telling us not to respect the provincial governments and just impose a regime , we will look into that . 
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the Prime Minister has his priorities wrong . 
it is for the taxpayers who will be paying the bill for the people on the trip ; the people who pay $ 1,000 a year on average because of trade barriers in Canada . 
an internal memo of the Department of Industry established that only 13 percent of the trade barriers had been struck down in the last agreement . 
when is the federal government going to assert its powers and leadership and deal with internal trade ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
wherever we go everyone says it is the biggest trade mission they have ever received .

canada POST 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Reform has just learned that the conciliator in the Canada Post labour dispute filed his report with the minister last Monday . 
when was this government planning to get around to telling the Canadian people that they are now on a 21 - day countdown for a national postal strike ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a postal strike is extremely devastating for Canadian business and non - business alike . 
a strike shuts down Canada ' s entire mail delivery system . 
the minister has already interfered in the bargaining process and he has failed to notify the Canadian public of the imminence of this strike . 
what is he going to do to protect Canadians from the impact of this national postal strike ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am certainly disappointed that my hon. colleague feels that there is going to be a strike . 
the collective bargaining process can work and will work . 
i certainly encourage both parties to work together to have a collective agreement that will be beneficial to both the union and the post office . 
* * * 
CALGARY DECLARATION 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we learned through the newspapers that the premiers , including the premier of Newfoundland , have decided to consult their fellow citizens regarding the Calgary declaration . 
does the Prime Minister realize that the fact that the premiers have chosen such inadequate tools for a consultation of this nature says a lot about how little importance they attach to their own Calgary declaration ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the premiers will use the means they deem appropriate to consult the public about the seven principles set out in the Calgary declaration , which the government of Canada fully supports . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , given the openness displayed by the government , I have a supplementary for the minister . 
when will we be told that a premier representing an English speaking province has decided to retain the services of Jojo the fortune teller to find out what the public in his province thinks ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , premiers will choose the appropriate means to consult the public . 
* * * 
canada PENSION PLAN 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today this government is proposing to introduce the single largest tax increase in history . 
working Canadians will be forced to pay up to $ 3,300 each year in the form of CPP payroll taxes for a maximum pension of only $ 8,800 a year when they retire . 
how can the Minister of Human Resources Development support such a bad so - called investment for Canadians ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , some time ago the chief actuary projected that unless the federal government and the provinces did not come together to deal with escalating premiums , he projected that they would have to go to over 14 percent in order to preserve the Canada pension plan , that in fact financial chaos would ensue . 
as a result of that , together with the provinces - let me be very clear - the federal government put in place a plan for more funding . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
how can the minister justify making Canadians pay more in CPP taxes when he has actually admitted that his chief actuary of the fund has said that there is no guarantee that increase will give the return that Canadians have been promised ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
quite the opposite , Mr. Speaker . 
the chief actuary has said that as a result of the actions taken by ourselves and the provinces , as a result of the fuller funding , as a result of some of the changes to the benefits , in fact we have now preserved the Canada pension plan for future generations of Canadians , for those who will receive disability pensions which they would not receive from the Reform Party , for those who would receive maternity benefits which they would not receive from the Reform Party . 
in fact we have put in place along with the provinces one of the most modern and one of the most progressive retirement systems in the world . 
Canadians are very proud of it and the Reform Party should be too .

CALGARY DECLARATION 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister . 
Andr é Tremblay , the former constitutional adviser to several of Quebec ' s premiers , including Robert Bourassa , said that the Calgary declaration was an empty shell , that it amounted to next to nothing . 
since even Quebec federalists are calling the Calgary declaration an empty shell , how can the Prime Minister see it as a huge step forward on which we can pin all our hopes ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if we are to have quality debates in this House , members would do well not to distort what has been said . 
the Prime Minister never said that it was a huge step forward on which we could pin all our hopes . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe : 
he said so yesterday . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur : 
yesterday , that ' s right . 
hon. St é phane Dion : 
we can pin our hopes on the fact that Canada is a country Quebecers want to keep . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
hon. St é phane Dion : 
and that is why they far prefer anything advancing Canadian unity to anything calculated to destroy the country , as one of the Bloc Quebecois members put it , and I am not distorting his words . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , perhaps the minister was listening to something else yesterday when the Prime Minister gave his own speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
i have another question for the minister . 
Daniel Johnson , who is recognized as a staunch federalist , is one of the few individuals in Quebec right now who can go around and defend , in any event , he is one of those defending the Calgary declaration . 
Mr. Minister , do you support - 
the Speaker : 
dear colleague , I think he heard the question . 
moreover , you must always address the Chair . 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in fact - 
some hon. members : 
yes or no ? 
hon. St é phane Dion : - if ever the Calgary declaration were to become an interpretive clause , which is possible , although it has not happened yet , of course , as it is under discussion , the interpretation given would guarantee Quebecers that the courts would take into account today ' s unique , as opposed to yesterday ' s distinct , character of Quebec society . 
there is not a single serious jurist who would say that being unique had anything less to recommend it than being distinct . 
* * * 
immigration 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration . 
as the minister is aware , there are in excess of 30,000 illegal immigrants in Canada today . 
can the minister confirm that there are in excess of 200 citizens of Vietnam in Canada under deportation order mostly for criminal activity ? 
can the minister confirm that the Canadian government is negotiating with the Government of Vietnam to take back a handpicked 100 of them ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what I can confirm officially is that annually in Canada we have over 200,000 immigrants who will become Canadian citizens and whom we are very proud to welcome . 
that is the federal system . 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I assure the minister that this party is just as happy with all the immigrants who come into this country legally as her party is . 
could the minister confirm , after she checks out what she is doing with the Government of Vietnam , that the federal government is greasing the wheels with the Vietnam government for acceptance of these deportees , that it is using an $ 8 million CIDA contract in Vietnam headed up by Marc Lalonde , a former government minister ? 
could she make sure the former minister is not part of what is going on to solve the problem she has with these Vietnamese deportees who are in Canada ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member of the Reform Party is so proud to welcome immigrants to Canada , he should not really be continuing to try to create myths about immigration . 
that is just what he is doing with this sort of question and it is unacceptable . 
this is the case with Vietnam , China and other countries . 
* * * 
canada POST CORPORATION 
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold Girard ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister responsible for Canada Post announced that his strategy in negotiations with the postal union was first to let the workers strike and then to negotiate special legislation to force them back to work . 
could the Prime Minister tell us if this is indeed his government ' s actual strategy to resolve the postal issue ? 
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
* * * 
public WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Mauril B é langer ( Ottawa - Vanier , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , would the Minister of Public Works and Government Services share with the House how the conflict opposing Bradson Security Services and its locked out security officers was finally resolved after almost a year ? 
would the minister also inform the House as to the measures the government will implement to avoid such deplorable situations in the future ? 
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me first inform the House that Bradson Security has negotiated a tentative agreement . 
members of the union will vote on October 3 . 
such a situation will not occur any more because last Friday we went out for new tenders . 
there is a clause for the future that will allow the suspension of any contractual obligation on both the suppliers and the government in case of a strike or lockout .

justice 
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the Supreme Court of Canada stated very clearly in a judgment it rendered that the meeting between Ted Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac which occurred on March 1 , 1996 was clearly inappropriate and breached the judicial independence of the courts . 
evidence in justice documents filed with the supreme court indicate that a false story and cover - up of this incident were created by senior justice officials . 
this is unacceptable . 
in the face of this incriminating evidence and the statements of the supreme court , will the new justice minister immediately dismiss the officials involved in this cover - up ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
i point out to the House that what the Supreme Court of Canada said today in a very important decision was that the justice official in question exercised bad judgment but did not act in bad faith . 
having said that , I reassure the hon. member that I will be taking under advisement that which the supreme court said and I will be reviewing it in the coming days . 
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the minister for her response . 
one of her own officials stated that if the real story were revealed " the damage done to the image of the department , the attorney general and the court will be incalculable for all time and the consequences could precipitate the resignations of the minister and the chief justice '' . 
again , will the justice minister immediately dismiss those involved in what her own official described as a false story and a cover - up ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
it was a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in which , yes , they did refer to an exercise of bad judgment by an official within the Department of Justice ; but they went on to conclude that the exercise of bad judgment should not lead to a stay of proceedings . 
i am very pleased to announce to the House this afternoon that the government will be proceeding in a very timely fashion with the three cases involving alleged war crimes .

employment INSURANCE 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
considerable time has gone by since the last changes to the employment insurance were introduced . 
the verdict is clear : ordinary people and seasonal workers are hard hit by the changes introduced by my predecessor , the former member for Acadie - Bathurst . 
consequently , is the government prepared to amend the Employment Insurance Act to ensure that children from families affected by the reform are not sent off to school on an empty stomach ? 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , our employment insurance reform came into effect a year ago . 
we have been monitoring its implementation very carefully and closely and we are measuring its impact to make sure the interests of Canadians from coast to coast are well served . 
i can tell you that , after 25 years of an employment insurance system that did not keep up with changes in the job market , it was imperative that it be reviewed , upgraded and brought up to date because it served Canadians very poorly . 
i can also tell you that we are watching the system ' s results very closely but we feel that , for the time being , it is in the interest of Canadians to move from passive to active measures within the system . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , are the minister and the government insensitive to the pain and suffering inflicted upon these families ? 
will this government stop stealing money from the unemployed by using the surplus in the employment insurance fund to reduce the deficit ? 
the Speaker : 
in my opinion , the word " stealing " is unparliamentary ; I would therefore ask my hon. colleague to withdraw it . 
Mr. Yvon Godin : 
i am sincerely sorry , Mr. Speaker , for using the word " stealing '' . 
so I will say " taking the money '' . 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
it has helped thousands of workers in the Atlantic region work in dignity instead of being limited to continual dependence on an income coming from outside . 
our respect for these workers is what has prompted us to commit to active measures with enhanced budgets which give them the dignity of real jobs , by moving from a system of passive measures to active measures . 
* * * 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Jean Dub é ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , over the years the government has continuously picked the pockets of Canadians through high employment insurance premiums . 
the Speaker : 
in view of the fact that I just had one member withdraw a word that had to do with stealing , I wonder if the hon. member would consider withdrawing the words " picked the pockets '' . 
Mr. Jean Dub é : 
Mr. Speaker , I will . 
in the Speech from the Throne the government announced that it planned to go ahead with the seniors benefits , which discourages retirement savings , attacks middle income seniors and earners , and punishes women . 
could the Minister of Human Resources Development tell us what his government has against Canadians who work , who want to work and who want peace of mind and security in retirement ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with respect to seniors benefits we are under great consultation now with seniors right across the country . 
we are bringing in these fundamental changes so that middle income and low income Canadians can be assured of a decent retirement . 
i would ask the hon. member to hearken back to the last time there was reform , when the Conservative Party sought to bring in pension reform on the backs of the lowest income earners , on the poorest in the country . 
we will not do that . 
Mr. Jean Dub é ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is going to let the Minister of Finance take money from Canadians instead of stopping the waste of their hard - won earnings . 
can the Minister of Human Resources Development explain to us why his government is intent on punishing a generation of Canadians in retirement when it has taxed them to death during their working years ? 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what the reform has done was to respond to a need , specifically the need to ensure that there would be pensions in the next century , without having to pay an exorbitant price for them . 
that is what we have done . 
this is a reform which was necessary . 
we are the first industrialized country faced with these changing demographics to address this problem with such courage . 
i believe that this government ' s courage in solving problems by addressing needs , not only for the next few years but for the next generations needs to be recognized .

international TRADE 
Ms. Bonnie Brown ( Oakville , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister for International Trade . 
in my constituency of Oakville I am receiving letters of concern about our negotiations toward a multilateral agreement on investment . 
is the minister prepared to ensure that there will be public consultations on the MAI and , if so , what mechanisms is he planning to use ? 
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me thank the hon. member for her question . 
currently we are engaged in negotiations to set rules and regulate the investment portfolio because today there are over 1,300 different bilateral investment agreements . 
in fact Canada has either signed or negotiated up to 50 of the agreements . 
there is a need to multilateralize . 
at the same time I am sensitive to the hon. member and other hon. members . 
obviously we need to do that in an open and transparent fashion . 
that is precisely the reason we have sent members of Parliament information packages , briefed our trade critics , offered briefings to our caucuses , as well as indicated to - 
the Speaker : 
that would bring to a close our question period for today .

business OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wish to ask the government House leader to advise the House of the nature of the government ' s business for the remainder of this week and into next . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me thank my colleague across the way for this excellent question . 
the House will continue debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne today , tomorrow and Monday . 
Tuesday shall be an allotted day . 
on Wednesday the House will consider a motion by the President of the Privy Council to establish a special joint committee to consider a proposed amendment to the Constitution regarding education in the province of Quebec . 
i expect to conclude the address debate next Thursday and Friday . 
while I am on my feet I wish to inform the House that it is the intention of the government to refer Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act that was presented to this Parliament earlier today to committee before second reading pursuant to Standing Order 73 ( 1 ) .

points OF ORDER 
comments DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) : 
thank you , Mr. Speaker , for recognizing me on a point of order arising from question period . 
you will have guessed that it has to do with the expression used in question period on which you intervened . 
it has to do with the expression " picking the pockets of Canadians '' . 
Mr. Speaker , I have looked in Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , page 142 , the section on unparliamentary language . 
unless I am mistaken - and I have not had a lot of time to examine precedents , as you will agree , Mr. Speaker - I have not found it in Beauchesne ' s . 
in fact , I think it is an expression that I have heard in this House before . 
it is an expression that I think is widely understood by members in the House as not being derogatory if that is not the intent of the person who is saying it . 
i would respectfully submit that the expression used by the member was an expression that should be allowed . 
the Speaker : 
many times in the course of the give and take in the House of Commons certain words are used and sometimes , as your Speaker , they seem to be inappropriate . 
i do not know if this word is in Beauchesne ' s or not , but sometimes it is the tone used with the word and sometimes it is circumstance , that causes disorder , etc. 
i hope the House would indulge me at the beginning . 
i will have a look at Beauchesne ' s again of course . 
however , I would prefer that we use words that are less inflammatory . 
i will surely look at the precedents and refresh my memory . 
if it is necessary I will come back to the House . 
with that said , this point of order is over unless the member has another point of order . 
hon. Jean J . Charest : 
Mr. Speaker , I did want to add a very brief comment because I think it is relevant to the way the House will operate and how you will , from the Chair , deal with these matters . 
i simply wanted to add that I find the same to be true for the word " bamboozle '' . 
i would appreciate if you would equally give consideration to that word in your research of precedents . 
the Speaker : 
if the hon. member wants me to look up the word " bamboozle '' , I will be happy to do that . 
we are going to go to tributes . 
i recognize the hon. member for Winnipeg - Transcona who will be saying a few words about a very dear colleague of ours who passed away , Mr. Stanley Knowles . 
* * * 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when the last Parliament adjourned we were still fortunate enough to be in the company of Mr. Stanley Knowles , the former member for Winnipeg North Centre . 
however , as everyone here will know , shortly after the general election of June 2 Mr. Knowles passed away just short of his 89 th birthday . 
at that time he was honoured appropriately on the Hill . 
in addition to the special honours that he received at that time from the House , from the government and from the Canadian people in a massive overwhelming way , we have a tradition in this place of paying tribute to former members . 
it is at this time that I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Knowles , the former member for Winnipeg North Centre , whose association with this place stretched over 50 years , 55 years from the time he was first elected in 1942 up until 1997 when he was still serving as an honorary officer of the table , with the exception of the four years that he spent out of office from 1958 to 1962 . 
but he first ran for Parliament in 1935 . 
we will miss him and we will miss having him here with us . 
of course as New Democrats we especially regret that he was not here to enjoy our return to this Parliament with the status of an official party . 
i know that my leader expressed similar sentiments yesterday when she spoke to the Speech from the Throne . 
Stanley Knowles was a great defender of veterans , of the poor , of women , of anyone who needed help , of anyone who should have been the object of our compassion , either individually or as a society . 
he saw government as something that could play a positive role in the economy and in the creation of social programs . 
he fought especially for the elderly and for pensions and for a decent public pension system in this country and he lived to see many of his dreams realized . 
unfortunately he also lived to see the day when some of those dreams began to unravel as part of the policies adopted in recent years . 
so many of us here , inspired by his work and by his commitment to such things , intend to continue that work and to defend and to promote the ideals that he represented in this place . 
i want to extend on behalf of my colleagues and I am sure on behalf of everyone our condolences to his family and our great appreciation of the gift that they gave to us , all the hours that Stanley Knowles spent in this place day after day , night after night . 
i remember seeing him the night before his stroke . 
it was 11 o ' clock in the evening in the hallway of the sixth floor of the Centre Block . 
he always paid attention to Parliament and cared about Parliament and cared about what Parliament was doing and how it was doing it . 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to be able take part in this tribute to the memory of the late Hon. Stanley Knowles . 
he was a vigorous spokesman for the elderly , for the poor , for the less favoured people in our society . 
he was an outstanding expert on the procedures and the rules of the House . 
he was one of the ornaments of the House of Commons in this and in previous generations . 
he will be very much missed . 
it will not be the same when we look toward you , Mr. Speaker , and do not see Mr. Knowles sitting at the table as honorary clerk , as the proceedings unwind . 
on behalf of the Government of Canada I would like to extend deepest sympathies and condolences to the family , the children and grandchildren of Stanley Knowles . 
he will be very much missed in this House and in our country . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I also join with other MPs in paying tribute to the late Stanley Knowles . 
Mr. Knowles ' contributions to this House and to Canada are well known . 
his consistent advocacy of social legislation to help the old , the sick , the young and the poor , his advocacy in defence of democracy mainly through the development and the improvement of the rules and procedures of the House , his contributions and accomplishments as a social democrat are a monument in themselves and there is little we can do to add to their lustre . 
there is one other dimension of Mr. Knowles ' life and career that we should not lose sight of in praising his accomplishments as a social democrat . 
Stanley Knowles began his career as a minister of the Christian gospel . 
all the old western populace movements , R é al , Social Credit , the Progressives , the CCF , which later became the NDP , all had a spiritual dimension to their beginnings and their mission . 
Mr. Knowles , like his friends and collaborators J . S . Woodsworth and Tommy Douglas who were also Christian ministers in the Methodist and Baptist traditions , was a part of the social gospel movement , a movement that true religion encompassed not only the vertical relationship of individuals to God but also the horizontal dimension of service to one ' s fellow man . 
i think of Stanley Knowles as a servant of Canada , as a servant of his party , as a servant of this House and a servant of the common people . 
but I also think of him as a servant of a higher master . 
it is an honour to pay tribute to him today in all the dimensions of his service . 
Mr. Louis Plamondon ( Richelieu , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure , on behalf of Bloc Quebecois members , to join with my colleagues in paying tribute to Stanley Knowles . 
when I became a member of this House , in 1984 , Mr. Knowles had just ended his last term as an active member of Parliament . 
a few months earlier , the Prime Minister had offered him , with the unanimous consent of the House , to sit at the clerk ' s table . 
everyone knows of his tremendous efforts to introduce social measures in this House . 
this is why he went into politics . 
he was elected to Parliament and quickly became an expert on procedure . 
i think his great parliamentary skills were confirmed during the famous pipeline debate , in 1956 . 
it was said that Parliament was not his second home , but his main residence . 
Stanley Knowles was a man of conviction ; he was always prepared to fight for the poor and the elderly . 
he was a man of courage , in spite of his physical frailty . 
he suffered from multiple sclerosis , but this never stopped him from fighting for the poor . 
he was an honest man , respectful of and respected by his political opponents . 
to his family , his friends and his party , I express , in my own name and on behalf of my colleagues , our most sincere condolences . 
i conclude with this beautiful line from the great French author Alexandre Dumas , who said " Those whom we have loved and lost are no longer where they were , but they are still everywhere we are '' . 
[ English ] 
behind the legend there was a mortal who saw his public duty , who was prepared to engage in public life to change things , and millions of Canadians benefited from his efforts , the poor , the veterans , the aged , to name a few . 
mention has been made of the high honour the House gave to Mr. Knowles by making him an honorary officer and giving him a seat at the table . 
people who watched the proceedings of the House perhaps remember him in that capacity in his latter years . 
as we set out at the beginning of this new Parliament perhaps it would be best to remember Stanley Knowles as a politician , a political warrior who was armed with the strongest armour that any of us can have , a writ of election and a seat in the House of Commons of Canada . 
it gave him the ability to confront the issues of our time as he confronted the issues of his with determination , unfailing courtesy and hard work . 
the families of politicians inevitably pay a price for this dedication . 
i hope that the pride that they are entitled to feel at the end of Mr. Knowles ' life tempers the sense of loss which , regardless of age and its infirmities , must still be great indeed . 
he was a House of Commons gentleman , a politician , a parliamentarian , and we are better in this country because of his dedication to Canada . 
on behalf of my party here , our deepest sympathy goes out to Mr. Knowles ' family . 
we want to say that we honoured him greatly and we still do in the remembrance of him . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today also on behalf of my colleague , the member for Winnipeg Centre , since both of us share in the privilege of representing a constituency that Stanley held for 38 years . 
our only regret today as we take up our rightful places in this Chamber is that Stanley Knowles is not looking over at us from his place at the centre of the table in this Chamber . 
we know that nothing would have made Stanley Knowles happier and prouder than to know that his constituency , one for which he worked so long and hard , had come home to the NDP on June 2 , 1997 . 
the member for Winnipeg Centre and I , and I believe all of my colleagues in our caucus and all parties in this House share in the responsibility of carrying on the legacy of Stanley Knowles . 
we know it is impossible to fill his shoes but we can strive to be like him , fighting for social justice with honour , pursuing righteousness with kindness . 
we also know that the best way to carry on his legacy and honour his work is to try to maintain the high standards he set for all of us , the standards of fighting persistently for social justice and always doing it with honesty and integrity . 
it is our turn to carry on the torch of Stanley Knowles , to carry on his fight for security for seniors , for equality for all people and hope for a better day . 
the best way we could pay tribute to Stanley is to use his own words , words he delivered in 1930 in a valedictory address to Brandon College . 
his memory seems to hallow the very ground on which we stand . 
government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
the House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his speech at the opening of the session , of the amendment and of the amendment to the amendment . 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is nice to be back here . 
i will be sharing my time with the member for Shefford . 
i want to congratulate you on your elevation to the Chair . 
most if not all of us would agree that you are a learned student of this House . 
i would say you have mastered the rules of procedure and you are very diplomatic in your skills and in handling numbers . 
congratulations . 
i want to thank my constituents for sending me here and for placing their trust in me . 
i want to let them know back home that I will do the very best job I can to represent them in this House . 
the name Charlotte really does not do justice to the description of the riding . 
one of the things that we will be entertaining is the possible name change for the riding to reflect those folks who live in some of the other counties . 
the throne speech was a big disappointment to me . 
it was filled with vague generalities and all kinds of platitudes with not a whole lot of meat or substance . 
i do not think many Canadians could find satisfaction in what they heard in that speech the other day , in particular when we note that Canada is going through a high rate of sustained unemployment . 
it is often said that the essence of life is hope . 
it is interesting that last week when the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed by a newspaper in Atlantic Canada he alluded to some of the poorer parts of his province which sometimes we do not understand . 
i think that some of the hurt that is being experienced in the country knows no bounds . 
i can talk about Atlantic Canada but there are other parts of Canada that are also going through some pretty tough times . 
it is often said that a real measure of a government should be how it deals with its poor , its elderly and its sick . 
after examining this government since 1993 , I would add to that list the youth of Canada . 
the government has failed miserably . 
it cannot seem to grasp the reality that there are a lot of people hurting . 
when we listen to the finance minister I believe he assumes that since everything is well on Wall Street and Bay Street , that everything is well in the rest of Canada . 
but let me tell the House it is not . 
that is one of the reasons the House did make some changes which were reflected during the election period . 
as members have returned to the House there is a decrease in the size of the majority of the government which it enjoyed in its first mandate . 
i believe that was for a very particular reason . 
i believe it is because there are lot of very disillusioned people . 
when we take a look at the unemployment rates in the country we are in the same situation . 
but I think one big reason we have had that sustained unemployment rate in Canada is a lack of vision on the part of the government . 
the government has been blessed by many things , some of them completely beyond its control or which it had nothing whatsoever to do with . 
it has been blessed with a period of economic growth since it took office but that has not actually been translated into real jobs . 
it has been blessed with very low international interest rates , which has played well for the government in terms of debt reduction , which again has nothing to do with the government itself . 
it has been blessed with some financial measures which any government could have fared better with than what it has . 
if we measure the reduction in spending in Ottawa since 1993 , over 90 percent of that has been downloaded on to the backs of the provinces . 
the statistics will tell us that only 2 percent of the cuts came out of downtown Ottawa and its government departments . 
the rest was downloaded on to the backs of the provinces . 
health care is an example . 
what the government and its finance minister and the prime minister forgot is that there is only one taxpayer . 
when they download on to the provinces they have to do one of two things , accept the download or download themselves on to the backs of the municipalities , again forgetting there is only one taxpayer . 
i do not think there is anyone in any part of this country who could stand up today to say with any degree of confidence that our health care system can sustain those types of cuts . 
if we measure what we have today versus what we had 10 years ago , there are a lot of Canadians who are very worried . 
it requires some ingenuity on the part of the government to recognize that there are problems out there which must be dealt with . 
in Atlantic Canada we are not talking about handouts ; we are talking about strategic investment into the area of the country that has the greatest amount of unemployment . 
just downloading onto the backs of the provinces , particularly the poorer provinces , is not going to solve the problem . 
we have the brain drain of Atlantic Canada . 
we educate our youth only to find that they have to move out to get a job . 
the old expression is that Atlantic Canada is a nice place to live , provided you can get a job . 
there is nothing in the throne speech which would give Atlantic Canadians , particularly young Atlantic Canadians , any degree of hope . 
it is incumbent on this government to take the message which was given to it on June 2 and respond to the needs of Atlantic Canada . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have listened to the speech of my colleague from the Conservative Party with interest and was unable to detect , in the part I was able to hear , any personal opinion on the matter of the amendment to the amendment by the Bloc Quebecois . 
i have two questions for my colleague from the Conservative Party . 
does the hon. member acknowledge that the Government ' s legislative program denies the existence of the Quebec people and its culture ? 
in responding to this question , can he tell us whether he will in fact vote in favour of the amendment we are proposing ? 
and even more fundamental than that , does the hon. member acknowledge the existence of the Quebec people as a people ? 
such recognition would make it possible to reach a solution to the constitutional problem which has been with us for more than 30 years . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
i believe that one of the best things the government could do for Canada - and obviously Canada in my eyes includes Quebec , a healthy Quebec , a Quebec that is as vibrant as we want to see the rest of Canada be - would be to get the economy moving in a way that brings everyone in . 
as I mentioned before , the government is taking a lot of pleasure in the growth in the stock market and how well Bay Street and Wall Street are doing , but it has forgotten that consumer confidence in Canada is at an all - time low . 
the sustained rate of unemployment is hurting us . 
ordinary Canadians have no confidence in the future . 
that includes the citizens of Quebec . 
anything we can do to help in creating a healthy , vibrant economy and anything that we can do to improve the lot of all citizens in the province of Quebec , English as well as French speaking , I am in favour of it and this party is in favour of it . 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I know that time is short so I will simply move to one of the member ' s statements and that was that there is only one taxpayer . 
the member probably will know that in the province of Ontario the Mike Harris government has extended a 15 percent tax decrease to the residents of Ontario . 
the member believes there is only one taxpayer . 
would he not agree that the impact of so - called downloading has not been as severe as he might suggest simply because the government feels it is important to have given that tax break notwithstanding any changes from federal transfers ? 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , if I were a member from Ontario I think I could stand up here and boast about the economy of my home province , but unfortunately I am not from Ontario . 
obviously that is one of the reasons why the Liberal Party won every seat , with the exception of one , that of my colleague just in front of me . 
it is because the people very seldom reject a government if the economy is moving well as evidenced in just about every election in the United States and Canada in the last 100 years . 
if I were living in downtown Toronto or Oakville , Ontario I would agree 100 percent with what the member has stated . 
they are basically satisfied with the government . 
this country as a whole is what I am worried about . 
that wealth and industrial prosperity has not spread across this country in the directions that we would like to see it spread . 
it has not spread north , east , or west in some areas . 
as I mentioned earlier in my speech , even places in British Columbia and Alberta have their problems , but in Atlantic Canada we have serious problems . 
one of the things that the government does have to take a look at is a reduction in taxes . 
the government is putting the problem right on the backs of the unemployed , the very people it should be helping . 
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would first like to congratulate you on your appointment . 
i would also like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Shefford for the confidence they showed in me in the recent federal election . 
i want them to know that I will work with all my heart to defend their interests . 
to return to Tuesday ' s speech from the throne , the government has revealed its political intentions . 
satisfied with the current state of the country and unable to offer Canadians a national vision with clear objectives for the country as a whole , the Chr é tien government has certainly set out its intentions , but without structure or time frame . 
it says nothing to me and enables them to improvise , as they always have . 
they turn whichever way the wind blows , taxing , cutting , taxing , spending . 
Tuesday ' s speech from the throne contained at least one piece of good news . 
the government will soon have a budget surplus . 
the bad news is that Canadians will not see a cent of it . 
the Liberal government now has to repair the damage it did in its first mandate and reinvest in the programs it had previously cut . 
you know , we should not be surprised , this is the Liberal style . 
we are here in the House of Commons to work together to build a better future for our country . 
the challenge facing Canada is of significant proportions and warrants all our energies and creativity . 
we must build for our children a country in which they can grow and develop without going hungry and without lacking quality health care , in a context that will encourage them to excel . 
my party , the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada , has developed a plan providing Canadians with a vision for the future that meets their aspirations and expectations , a simple , down to earth and unifying plan . 
time has come to take new approaches and to offer new solutions . 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada has already come up with a plan that will give Canadians a vision , a down to earth plan for the future of our country . 
however , a vision and a plan are not enough . 
leadership is required to achieve key priorities . 
our program for growth has three main thrusts : sound management of taxpayers ' money ; quality of life for our fellow citizens and , finally , initiatives for a brighter future . 
quite simply , what sound management of taxpayers ' money stands for is the need for any responsible government to introduce legislation to make fiscal balance mandatory , lower employment insurance premiums and reduce personal income tax . 
concerned with putting its financial house in order , the government , during its first mandate , brought all existing support programs and the Canada Assistance Plan together under a single umbrella called the Canada health and social transfer . 
once again , concern about saving money took precedence over common sense , and government assistance was cut by $ 7 billion over four years with the results that we know . 
instead of federal transfers leaving the provinces at the mercy of the federal government ' s goodwill , we are proposing a tax point transfer to the provinces and territories to ensure stable funding . 
this way , provincial and territorial governments would be forever protected against cuts like those imposed by the Liberals . 
in addition , the public would receive services from governments that are closer to them and their situation . 
we applaud the government ' s desire to end child poverty . 
unfortunately , its efforts are directed more at the consequences of the problem than at the problem itself . 
there are 1.5 million children living in poverty in Canada . 
these children are poor because their parents are poor . 
their parents are poor because the government has focused all its attention on one thing : the deficit . 
and all the while , Canadian workers , children and the elderly have been paying the price . 
the government even admits in the throne speech that it has the means to improve our children ' s lives and that it intends to invest in their well - being . 
let us remember that the money referred to by the government in its speeches has already been committed in the two previous years ' budgets . 
let us be clear : the government is promising us money it has already invested and it is promising to invest at least that much again . 
is this another of those elusive promises , like the 150,000 day care spaces , or will the federal government actually make a commitment this time ? 
of all the promises made by the Liberals during the election campaign , let us hope that those concerning children will be kept , and kept a little better than the motion passed in the House of Commons in 1989 to end child poverty by the year 2000 . 
if the current trend continues , the child poverty rate will have doubled by then . 
at the present time , over 1,500 food banks and hundreds of soup kitchens are waging the fight against hunger . 
under the present government ' s plan , millions of children will still go to school hungry tomorrow . 
it is unfortunate that this sad reality is only brought home to us during electoral periods . 
it is not surprising that election - minded politics like this have undermined the credibility of our institutions . 
when the public has regained faith in its public institutions , we will have the stability and confidence necessary to move forward . 
the country needs leadership with the courage to renew and revitalize the federation in order to show that it can work to everyone ' s satisfaction . 
the premiers have agreed on a work plan and on the main areas of discussion . 
i am convinced that it is possible to find a basis for agreement . 
Canadians from all walks of life will not waste much time in extremist rhetoric , and they will demonstrate their attachment to Canada , I am sure . 
it is time again for us to join forces around a common ideal . 
the polls clearly demonstrate that Quebecers have Canadian values at heart and want to remain within the country they helped build . 
let us not get hung up on the words , the reality is clear . 
Quebecers are Quebecers , and just as proud to be Canadians . 
what is less clear is that , in neither the last referendum nor the last electoral campaign , not even in the meeting at Calgary , was there any manifestation of leadership by our Prime Minister . 
i apologize for not mincing any words , but his leadership is worn out . 
our dynamic team , representing a new generation of politicians , will advance some constructive ideas which will rally the population . 
rest assured that the only leader with a vision of the future for Canada is the man you heard yesterday , Jean Charest , and the true opposition which can speak on behalf of all Canadians is the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada . 
Mr. John Cannis ( Scarborough Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I remember in 1967 the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup and 90 percent of the team was made up of older players who brought a wealth of experience and knowledge to the team . 
punch Imlach was able to bring the Stanley Cup to the Toronto Maple Leafs . 
similarly , this administration and its leaders with a wealth of knowledge and expertise has done many things . 
i congratulate the member on her election . 
she referred to damage done by the Liberal government ' s first mandate . 
i have a question for the hon. member . 
she talked about lowering payroll taxes . 
is the member aware that when the Liberal government took over in 1993 the Conservative government had it pegged at $ 3.30 per $ 100 ? 
does she know what the Liberal government did from day one until now ? 
if she does not know , I will be glad to remind her . 
if she does know , I would like her to point out what the payroll taxes are today as opposed to what they were under a Conservative government . 
Ms. Diane St - Jacques : 
Mr. Speaker , I will try to respond . 
i did not understand everything the hon. member said , but I think the deficit he is talking about was created by the Liberals . 
we too had to deal with that deficit , and , had the Conservative government not introduced free trade , we would not be where we are today . 
Mr. Maurice Godin ( Ch â teauguay , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the remarks of my colleague from Shefford . 
i would like to ask her a question , because it is all very well to talk of the economy , but I think the most important thing is simply to reach a common understanding . 
what is the role of each province in the Constitution ? 
Ms. Diane St - Jacques : 
Mr. Speaker , my answer to the hon. member is that I am a Quebecer , I am proud to be a Quebecer and a Canadian , and that if we consider the latest polls , many Quebecers still want to be part of Canada . 
we must keep talking to try and find a solution . 
Mr. Paul DeVillers ( Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
it is a great pleasure to speak to this House in reply to the throne speech , which outlines the government ' s priorities for the first session of the 36 th Parliament . 
i would like to start by thanking the people of Simcoe North for renewing their vote of confidence by granting me a second term in the federal election last June . 
i would also like to mention the inestimable support I have received from my wife and family . 
optimism is no longer the exception but the rule , since we now have regained the ability to address the priorities of Canadians fairly and equitably . 
i would like to expand on three themes we find in the throne speech : social reform , economic reform and national unity . 
the legislation that will be introduced to implement the proposed changes to the Canada Pension Plan and the non - taxable seniors benefit will , I believe , ensure that our public pension system will remain sustainable for generations to come . 
i may point out that when the seniors benefit comes into effect in 2001 , benefits for our neediest seniors will increase . 
in fact , about 75 percent of seniors , which includes nine elderly women out of ten , will have an income that is either equal to or higher than their present income . 
i support unconditionally the government ' s commitment to maintain a comprehensive public health care system that provides universal access to high quality care for all Canadians . 
the announcement that the government , working with its partners , will develop a national plan , time table and fiscal framework for setting up a system that guarantees access to medically necessary drugs , and will also support home and community care , shows that the message sent by Canadians about public health care has been received and understood by this government . 
i am very proud of the government ' s economic record . 
the throne speech reflects our commitment to thoughtful economic management . 
i would like to mention some examples of this commitment , for instance a balanced budget no later than 1998 - 99 . 
this will be the first time in almost 30 years that the country has had a balanced budget . 
the government achieved the first annual surplus since 1982 . 
all the spending contained in the throne speech is funded by budgetary surpluses . 
i want to be crystal clear on this point . 
the budgetary surpluses during this mandate will be the source of funding for new programs . 
the government will not be relying on borrowing moneys . 
we will not be spending our children ' s inheritance . 
fifty per cent of budgetary surpluses will go to investments in social and economic priorities and fifty per cent will go to tax reduction and debt repayment . 
this 50:50 split ensures that the Liberal commitments to sound economic planning and to social responsibility will go hand in hand . 
this strategy consolidates over $ 2 billion in new and existing programs and services for young people . 
the government will also work with the business community and the provinces to forecast areas of job growth . 
this planning ahead is a concrete example of how the government will help young people meet the challenges of the job market . 
i recently lead community consultation on job creation in my riding of Simcoe North . 
the citizens of Simcoe North felt that apprenticeship and training programs would help young people get into fulfilling and well paying jobs . 
they also felt that the perception of various kinds of jobs needs to improve . 
for example , the skilled trades should be valued for the contribution they make to a vibrant economy . 
the government will be initiating measures similar to those suggested by the people of Simcoe North . 
internship programs will be extended and expanded . 
the government will provide enhanced funding for student summer placements . 
a Canada - wide mentorship program will be created in partnership with the provincial governments and the private sector . 
once again the government has shown that it is listening to Canadians and working with them to secure a better future for young Canadians . 
i am particularly encouraged by the government statement on national unity . 
first , the government is committed to the recognition of Quebec ' s unique language , culture and legal system . 
the government will work closely with provincial and territorial leaders to advance the progress made in the Calgary declaration . 
recognition of Quebec ' s unique character , language and legal system will not entail any new powers , privileges or rights . 
this message must be carried to all Canadians in every province and region . 
second , the government will ensure that the national unity debate is conducted with clarity and frankness . 
it is critical that Quebeckers , especially francophone Quebeckers , understand the consequences and the implications of separation . 
it is equally fundamental that Canadians outside Quebec understand the same consequences and the implications . 
in the words of the throne speech : 
- the government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate that puts into question the future existence or unity of Canada . 
it will create a better understanding of the true complexity and difficulty for all of us in severing ties - 
i congratulate the government on the commitment to deal assertively to bring clarity to this debate . 
none of this government ' s programs could be carried out if our national unity initiatives were not successful . 
the government therefore views its mandate in that area in a global and encompassing fashion . 
any measure that strengthens the country will have a unifying effect on Canada . 
that having been said , we pledge to work in partnership with the provinces and territory . 
our federation as we know it is flexible . 
this needs to be repeated over and over in the presence of separatists . 
far from being fixed and immovable , our federation is one that keeps evolving . 
during this second mandate , we will continue to reflect and meet the demands of every province and region . 
i am confident that , with such flexibility and the synergy fostered by this government , we will enter the new millennium with a new invigorated Canada . 
i realize that Canadians have done a great deal to help the federal government put its financial house in order and strengthen the social and political fabric of Canada . 
we have come a long , hard way , but the end is in sight . 
to conclude , I want to reaffirm my solemn commitment to represent my constituents to the best of my abilities and to co - operate with all members of this House to ensure our government reflects and is sensitive to the needs of all Canadians . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very proud to be here today . 
i feel privileged to represent the constituents of Kings - Hants . 
kings - Hants includes the Annapolis Valley where we grow the best apples in the world as well as the Hants Shore where the Minas Basin provides the highest tides in the world . 
i am sure the members of the government will recognize the strength of tides in the recent election . 
the recent electoral tides in Atlantic Canada sent a signal that Atlantic Canadians were not simply frustrated with cuts but instead were frustrated with the lack of vision demonstrated by the government to the needs of Atlantic Canada . 
Atlantic Canadians want a future where they have access to the free enterprise system and can utilize the tools of the free enterprise system to build a stronger , more self - reliant Atlantic Canada . 
i am a Conservative , an Atlantic Canadian and a small business person . 
none of these are mutually exclusive . 
earlier today the member for Medicine Hat referred to the member for Saint John as a New Democrat because she expressed compassion for the underprivileged . 
compassion is not partisan in principle . 
compassion is something we all should have within the House . 
while some members in this House prefer to talk about fights for the right , there are some of us who prefer to simply work hard for what is right . 
Mr. Paul DeVillers : 
Mr. Speaker , I would first like to indicate that the hon. member has some tremendous shoes to fill in representing the riding of Kings - Hants . 
for instance , the new commitment of another $ 850 million to the child tax credit is something that will address the concerns that were addressed by the member in the prelude to his question . 
that is but one example of the vision that we need to show . 
Mr. Antoine Dub é ( L é vis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as Acting Speaker . 
i wish to draw your attention to the speech made by the hon. member , who is an experienced member of this House , and who speaks in English in a certain way and in French in a different way . 
i heard him speak in English about being firm . 
when alluding to the issue of national unity in English he advocated the hard line , because he was addressing English Canadians , of course , but he used a much more conciliatory tone in French . 
the hon. member for Simcoe North speaks good French since he is a francophone , but he is also the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
is the hon. member prepared to do that ? 
Mr. Paul DeVillers : 
Mr. Speaker , the Bloc Quebecois ' strategy in this debate is clearly to ask all Liberal members the same question . 
of course , we use inclusive terms such as " society '' . 
the word " people " has several connotations which may give rights in international law , but we use the word " society " because it is more inclusive . 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen ( Windsor - St. 
Clair , Lib . ) : 
congratulations , Mr. Speaker . 
Clair for their support in the June election . 
i am honoured to be asked to represent them once again and their faith in our government is not misplaced . 
i wish also to thank the many volunteers who supported our campaign and whose friendship I cherish very much . 
Windsor - St. 
those things included health care , education , unemployment and in particular , youth unemployment . 
these were local concerns but we would be mistaken to think that the constituents of Windsor - St. 
Clair have only local concerns . 
indeed they were also concerned about national unity , Canada ' s role as a trading nation and Canada ' s role as an international broker of peace , her role generally in the global village . 
not only did we listen but we are putting in place programs to alleviate the concerns that I have outlined . 
all the while we are maintaining our steady attack on both the deficit and the debt . 
canada will never under a Liberal government , in any event , return to the financial crisis that we faced when we came to power in 1993 . 
in addition to funds for health and education , we will continue our attack on unemployment in general and youth unemployment in particular . 
programs like Youth Services Canada are already operating in Windsor - St. 
Clair to give young people work experience and a wage while they serve our community . 
i would like to urge the government to work with us on more specific areas which will help our community to prosper even more . 
it is my belief that an economically prosperous community is able to better overcome other social problems . 
it is my belief that economic prosperity will lead generally to a better quality of life , to lower crime rates , to a lack of other social problems , to lower welfare rates and to a generally better lifestyle . 
one way to do that is to offer more support to our local industries . 
it is no secret that Windsor is Canada ' s motor city . 
i like to say that Windsor is effectively the centre of the universe , but that may not be the case for some of my colleagues . 
i can say however that it is urgent and very important for our community to see support from the government for the automotive industry . 
the automotive industry employs directly or indirectly approximately half of working Ontarians . 
it is of the utmost importance for the Government of Canada to focus on issues like tariffs , apprenticeship training for skilled trades and on other areas that will offer support to our domestic automotive industry . 
Clair or Windsor - Walkerville as it was then , the Hon. Paul Martin , Sr . , the auto pact was signed . 
the auto pact has reached an almost sacred position in our community because the auto pact is the engine that allows those industries to exist , to prosper and employs our citizens . 
in my view it is important that the government continue to focus on agreements like the auto pact , to give them support and strength so that we will have more employment , more prosperity and therefore a better quality of life in Windsor , Tecumseh , St. Clair Beach and in the province of Ontario generally . 
it is important also that we support other industries . 
in the last five or six years the tourism industry has become vital to our community . 
tourism and particularly the gambling industry fuelled by Casino Windsor have become extremely important . 
however , there is a fly in the ointment . 
that fly comes from the Conservative government of the province of Ontario which has consistently refused and neglected to take the steps necessary in order to allow the government to legalize some aspects of gambling which would help the casino to prosper . 
i am talking specifically about games of dice . 
in the near future we will be faced with competition from gambling facilities in the city of Detroit . 
those gambling casinos will have dice games . 
it is important that Windsor have the opportunity to compete but the initiative has to come from the attorney general of Ontario . 
in spite of consistent promises to the mayor and citizens of Windsor who want this to happen , nothing has been done to approach our attorney general in order to start the dice rolling , as we say in Windsor . 
tourism is a very important part of what our community can provide to Canada . 
it is a very important part of the puzzle that is unemployment . 
the more tourism there is , the more service jobs and jobs in tourism there will be . 
it seems to me that it is just a simple matter of a member of the Ontario government picking up a pen and writing a little note and whisking it off to the Attorney General of Canada . 
once it gets here I am sure the Essex County lobby and others can make sure that the request gets the significant attention it deserves . 
we are a town that provides what I like to think of as one of Canada ' s basic food groups , Canadian Club whisky . 
Canadian Club is an agri - food product and is also a great symbol of our country in my view . 
the federal government has been trying to initiate discussions with the provinces . 
however , it is time for all of us to take a look at this commodity which provides hundreds of jobs in my community . 
the factory is a historic one and it is very important to the community that this serious problem be discussed . 
in general foreign trade is very important to Windsor . 
i would encourage the Prime Minister to continue his trade missions and to continue to invite businessmen and women from Windsor , Tecumseh and St. Clair Beach to join him as he promotes Canada around the world . 
as Windsor prospers economically our other problems subside . 
our crime rate is lower than it has ever been . 
when one is downtown in the evening going to a movie or to one of our wonderful restaurants there is a sense of vitality and prosperity there that I challenge any other community in Canada to meet . 
i would urge the government to take a look at those things I have outlined that are specifically of importance to Windsor . 
i would also urge the government to continue on the track it is on , and I would ask all members to support the motion of the hon. member from Parkdale with respect to the throne speech . 
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) : 
i think she indicated she would continue to attack the employment situation . 
i come from a region of the country that has suffered unemployment rates of between 15 percent and 20 p . cent for the continual life of the Liberal government . 
will the hon. member recognize that there is nothing in the throne speech to address the urgent needs of Cape Bretonners and Newfoundlanders and people in Atlantic Canada who have persistently suffered under this economic policy ? 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen : 
no , I will not acknowledge that , Mr. Speaker . 
i think my hon. friend misses the point here . 
the point is this is a throne speech which leads us down the track of prosperity . 
just as I am disappointed that they did not mention Windsor , Tecumseh and St. Clair Beach , the virtual centre of the universe , I am sure he is disappointed that his towns were not mentioned specifically either . 
the fact is this is a good general plan . 
within that plan there will be solutions for Sydney , for the Cape Breton Island , for Windsor , for Tecumseh , for St. Clair Beach . 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier ( Manicouagan , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too wish to congratulate you on your appointment as acting speaker of the House . 
since I am a new member , I would like to take this opportunity to thank my constituents in Manicouagan . 
Manicouagan is one of the loveliest ridings in Quebec . 
i listened with great interest to the hon. member ' s speech and I have two questions for her . 
does she admit that the government ' s legislative program denies the existence of the people of Quebec and of their culture ? 
does the member recognize the existence of the people of Quebec , and if so , is she going to support and vote in favour of the amendment presented by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois ? 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen : 
Mr. Speaker , I see a theme evolving on the Bloc benches . 
there is a theme on the government benches too . 
we recognize that there is a Canadian people made up of a great many diverse groups . 
i am proud to be a Canadian . 
i am pretty much satisfied that the majority of Quebeckers are proud to be Canadians as well . 
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you , sir , on your appointment to the Chair . 
you look great . 
i appreciate the comments that have been made but I wanted to raise a question about the throne speech opening up a pathway to prosperity . 
the difficulty I see in my riding is that I talk to elderly people who are having to sell their homes because of clawbacks . 
they have small incomes and they cannot afford to pay the taxes . 
youth cannot get enough money for education . 
men and women are losing established jobs from established companies and those jobs are not being replaced . 
i see nothing in this throne speech which would offer hope to these people . 
is there some mechanism which the Liberal government has in mind to guarantee that taxes will not be raised and to give Canadians relief from the taxation which is killing us economically and destroying the social fabric of the lives of so many families ? 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen : 
Mr. Speaker , that was a long question and , leaving aside the preamble , the nub of it was are we going to cut taxes . 
the answer is that there is still a deficit and there is still a debt . 
as well we have some spending to do to assist Canadians with respect to health care , education and youth unemployment . 
let me say that when the deficit is settled , when we are sure that the country is healthy , we will spend time looking at taxation . 
we will spend time looking at the debt . 
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to be able to speak today in response to the throne speech . 
i want to thank the constituents of Prince George - Bulkley Valley who in the June election gave me a huge victory . 
it is predicted that the Liberal government will in 1998 - 99 achieve a balanced budget , using Liberal numbers . 
i do not know whether we can trust Liberal numbers , but let us say they are fairly accurate . 
it must be remembered that this could be the first balanced budget that we have had in some 30 years . 
it is sort of ironic considering that some members of the government are the same members who sat in previous Liberal governments which helped to run up our massive debt and helped to create our deficits which occurred year upon year . 
it is surprising but at the same time I suppose somewhat remarkable . 
before anyone decides to heap any praise on the Liberal Party for this predicted balanced budget it is important to clearly identify the reasons why this balanced budget may be occurring . 
i do not think the Liberals should be expecting any praise for the prediction of a balanced budget . 
i suggest that this Liberal government should be giving thanks to the millions of Canadian taxpayers who have been taking all the hits over the last three and a half years as the Liberals have attempted to dig themselves out of this massive financial pit that they along with the Tories , cheered on by the NDP , have created for Canadians . 
i would like to give the House some examples . 
i am talking about the employers and the employees of the country who have contributed significantly to the reduction of the deficit through employment insurance overpayments . 
let us make it clear that the Liberals have been treating the EI surplus as if it were their own money to put toward deficit reduction and to cover their wasteful spending . 
everyone who can think clearly has to consider the EI overpayments as being simply another tax . 
that is what it is , another tax . 
would it not be preferable to let Canadian workers keep the amount of this EI overpayment and let them have the freedom to spend , invest or save ? 
all these things would create jobs in this country and would help to get a more buoyant economy . 
would it not be preferable to let Canadian businesses and employers keep their overpayment to the EI fund as well so they could invest in their businesses and hire more people , which would also lead to the creation of a more buoyant economy ? 
talking about people who have taken hits , let us not forget the public servants in this country who have been working since 1990 without a raise . 
they have also been forced to make a tremendous sacrifice because of previous Liberal - Tory overspending . 
i also believe the Liberals should give thanks for their deficit reduction prediction to the people in Canada ' s poorer provinces who have had to bear the brunt of Liberal offloading because of reduced equalization payments . 
this is my favourite one . 
let us not forget that during the last three and a half years of Parliament this Liberal government , this very Liberal government that is going around looking for pats on the back for its balanced budget prediction , increased taxes in this country in 36 different areas . 
there were 36 individual tax increases brought in by this government . 
it wrenched out of the pockets of ordinary Canadians , Canadian businesses and Canadian investors over $ 25 billion in increased tax revenue . 
let us not forget that . 
is the government heading for a balanced budget because it has been prudent in saving money ? 
Mr. Speaker , I know you will agree with me that is not the case . 
let us not forget how the Liberals got there . 
let us not be too anxious to go over and pat them on the backs as they are expecting . 
we see the Liberals running around seeking praise for such a great job they say that they have done but , to use the famous phrase of the finance minister , the fact is what they have really been doing is pulling on their magic tax lever to fill their coffers while Canadian businesses and Canadian workers have had less and less to spend , less and less to invest and less and less to save . 
in the throne speech they mentioned the word partnership many times , over 10 times . 
given the Liberals ' performance one can only assume that the Liberal definition of partnership means " you work , send us most of your wages and hey , we ' re partners '' . 
the sad part of this is that despite all the taxes Canadians are paying , by the end of the century we will still only be getting about 68 percent in services for every dollar they send to this place . 
let us also remember that these tax and spend Liberals are not as compassionate as they like to appear . 
they took little or no notice of the pain they were inflicting on Canadian families , Canadian workers and Canadian businesses over these last three and a half years as they grabbed this tax lever and over and over again pulled it and pulled billions of dollars more into their coffers . 
to add insult to injury , at the same time these Liberals were heaping tax upon tax on the Canadian people , they were still pursuing their insatiable appetite for spending money in ridiculous and wasteful ways . 
our member for St. Albert has a weekly waste report . 
i would like to read a few of the ways the Liberals have spent some of the money so that people can get this into perspective . 
the Liberals thought it prudent to give the multibillion dollar company American Express $ 17,000 . 
one has to ask did they get any flyer points for that . 
how about Big Bill ' s furniture and appliance store , $ 176,000 . 
i wonder if that is a relative of one of the Liberal ministers . 
how about Nothing Fancy stores , $ 89,000 . 
here is one that I should not be upset about but I am . 
a golf tournament for literacy received $ 85,000 . 
i go out and look for sponsors , supporters and people who believe in the cause . 
i do not look to the Canadian taxpayer for money . 
it goes on and on . 
one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars was given to a committee to study the sexual habits of seniors . 
one has to assume that by the time someone gets to be a senior he or she probably has his or her sex life figured out pretty well . 
the throne speech is like a shell game . 
i am glad that we are the official opposition because without the Reform Party here the Liberals would not even be talking about reducing the deficit . 
i assure the House that we are going to keep the pressure on . 
with the Reform Party as the official opposition , and these Liberals know it , the government is finally going to learn the difference between good spending and bad spending . 
i know the difference , Reformers know the difference and ordinary Canadians know the difference . 
by the time this Parliament is through , the Liberals are going to know the difference . 
Mr. Joe Comuzzi ( Thunder Bay - Nipigon , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to be able to respond to the question posed by my friend from Prince George . 
first , let me congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on assuming your position in the chair today . 
we are sure that you will fulfil the mandate required of all Speakers . 
all of us on this side of the House wish you well . 
someone on the other side who was speaking earlier made some reference to your looks . 
i can tell you , Mr. Speaker , from my advantage point down here you look a lot better than the people to your left . 
i am really quite taken aback by my friend who just spoke . 
evidently he has not been listening to his leader for the last two or three years . 
all we have heard from the Reform Party is its interest in making sure that we had a balanced budget and that we reduced a horrendous debt that was left to us . 
if not kissing cousins , they slept in close proximity to each other . 
the debt that we inherited in 1993 was what the Reform Party , when it first came into the House , talked about incessantly . 
what we have done as a Liberal government in four short years is simply this . 
we have eliminated the deficit which is what Reformers have been talking about . 
once we have the deficit in this country under control then we can take a good run at working on the debt that was assumed by their kissing cousins or whatever way we want to refer to them . 
before we took government , if they look at the facts of the situation , the debt in this country was $ 140 billion . 
when the Conservative government left power it was about $ 530 billion . 
we have been able to temper that debt over the last four years by something under $ 600 million . 
we are beginning to reduce the debt because we know how to administer the financial affairs of the country . 
that is basically what their leader has been saying and that is what we have done . 
i cannot believe that my good from from Prince George is not giving the Liberal Party and ourselves the credit for that . 
i would like him to respond to that , but just one more minute . 
i want to know what my friend from Prince George has against finding out about the sexual habits of seniors ? 
what has the hon. member got against the senior citizens in this country ? 
could he respond to that please . 
Mr. Dick Harris : 
first of all , Mr. Speaker , let me assure the member from Thunder Bay that he will never ever find a Reformer kissing a Tory . 
that is a certain thing . 
second , I have nothing against seniors having fun . 
my parents are seniors and they are always happy , so obviously they do not need any books . 
there is an interesting point about reducing the deficit though . 
yes , we have been talking about this Liberal government getting the deficit reduced . 
the difference is that we wanted the government to reduce it by cutting its insatiable spending appetite , by cutting the grants and handouts that are rampant throughout the waste reports , by cutting the patronage organizations , such as the western economic diversification fund and the economic development funds that are in eastern Canada , all the hundreds of millions of dollars that it gives to Quebec companies to keep the Bloc off its back . 
we ask the government to be more prudent and reduce its spending . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all I would like to congratulate you on your appointment . 
i would also like at the beginning of my maiden speech in the House of Commons to thank my constituents for this great privilege . 
it is a humbling experience to stand in this great Chamber of democratic deliberation for the first time and experience what the veterans are familiar with . 
i only hope that I can , in whatever modest way , meet the aspirations and expectations of my constituents of Calgary Southeast . 
it occurred to me that it was simply a more stilted and formal version of the 56 page red book II , the one that we released ahead of the Prime Minister . 
it was a book filled with congratulations . 
the government congratulated itself on what it sees somehow as a brilliant record . 
but let us take a closer look at that fiscal and economic record . 
the Liberals talk about job creation and prosperity . 
what we have today is 1.4 million Canadians out of work . 
we are now in the 98 th straight month of unemployment over 9 percent , the longest string of high unemployment since the great depression . 
that is the economic record of this government . Youth unemployment is over 17 percent . 
they have lost economic opportunity because of the policies of this government . 
we have seen a 7 percent decline in the after tax family income of the average family since the beginning of this decade because of the tax increases of the Liberal government and its Tory predecessor . 
a quarter of Canadians tell us that they go to bed worried about job security , worried about whether the next day they are going to have enough money to put bread on the table and take care of their families . 
we see anaemic economic growth of under 3 p . cent . 
while we have 9 percent unemployment , our largest trading partner , the United States , has an unemployment rate of almost half that . 
our second largest trading partner , Japan , has an unemployment rate at a third of that level . 
the government calls this an economic record to be proud of . 
the Liberals tell us that they have managed nearly to balance the budget which they helped to create over the last 25 years with their Conservative friends . 
how did they do that ? 
by acting responsibly as so many of the provincial governments did ? 
by acting in the same way a small business or family would by paring back the non - essentials , by cutting ? 
no , it was done by increasing the tax burden on Canadian families , by killing jobs , by increasing payroll taxes . 
it has income tax hikes riding on top of the de - indexation of the tax system imposed by the Tories in 1986 . 
that grosses $ 23 billion in new government revenues through 36 tax increases on top of the 72 tax increases introduced by the Mulroney Tories . 
that is the shameful fiscal record of this government . 
and what has it done ? 
it has added $ 100 billion of debt and called it responsible fiscal management . 
that $ 100 billion brings our total indebtedness to just under $ 600 billion which , of course , does not include another $ 600 billion in the Canada pension plan Ponzi scheme for which my generation is going to have to pay . 
that is the fiscal record of this government which has led to $ 47 billion a year in annual interest payments , a sum large enough to be the operating budgets of five of the the smaller provincial governments . 
that is a shameful record and one it ought not to applaud . 
so what is the answer ? 
one would think that here in this last Parliament of this century , in this throne speech which sets the agenda for the new millennium that there would be a great vision , a new departure , a new direction for Canada . 
it might take the advice of the overwhelming majority of the people in the business communities who know how to create wealth because they do it every day . 
instead , the government has gone back to the traditional , old 1970 s Liberal policies of bigger government , chequebook politics , trying to buy the votes of its special interest friends by opening up the treasury yet once more for all its pet projects . 
the throne speech is filled with page after page of new spending programs . 
there was only one mention of tax decreases and debt reduction while we are sitting in the midst of an economic crisis in the country . 
there is no imagination , no vision in this throne speech . 
the government ' s throne speech is filled with talk about children who do not seem to have families , children who seem to be the worthy recipients of government programs designed by the Liberal government ' s social engineers . 
it does not talk about traditional families who choose to have a parent stay at home to raise their children receiving tax fairness , even though this House with all party support in the last Parliament passed Motion No. 30 sponsored by the member for Mississauga South , calling for tax fairness in the tax code . 
the government has done nothing to act on that . 
it seems to be satisfied with penalizing families who make the sacrifice of giving up a second income to get by . 
they really believe that Liberal politicians and big government bureaucrats know better how to spend a dollar raised from the taxpayers than does a family or small business person or someone who is struggling to get a foot up in the labour market . 
i want the government to listen to the message it got from the last election . 
it came within a whisker of losing power . 
we know that the Liberal Party exists to take and maintain power . 
the government ought to listen to the message that was sent by the voters . 
what about tax fairness for families ? 
heaven forbid , what about cutting capital gains taxes to increase investment and productivity , to reward people for taking risks in our economy ? 
what about cutting payroll taxes so that we are not penalizing people for creating jobs and small businesses ? 
what about cutting income taxes and doing it now so that people can see the light at the end of the tunnel and not just another big government spending program ? 
why can it not see that there is a different solution . 
in closing I invite my colleagues on the opposite side of the House to take a serious look at the kind of economic record that 30 years of Liberal and Tory big government spending has brought us . 
governments around the world are doing that . 
the government ' s ideological friend in Washington , President Bill Clinton , a Democrat , said last year that the era of big government is over . 
the Labour Prime Minister in the United Kingdom said that the end of the welfare state has come . 
yet this government is the only Liberal government in the developed world which seems to think that the old policies of the welfare state are the ones that can sustain a healthy and prosperous economy . 
their allies overseas and outside this country know differently . 
governments like the New Democratic one in Saskatchewan know differently . 
provincial governments that have made the hard decisions know differently . 
it is time that this government finally came down on the side of fiscal responsibility , growth , hope and opportunity for Canadians by providing them with real meaningful tax relief . 
Mr. Reg Alcock ( Winnipeg South , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to start by congratulating the member on what I believe is his first speech in the House . 
i would like to welcome him to the House . 
i am going to try to be very quick because I know the member for Broadview - Greenwood would also like to ask a question . 
we on this side of the House heard the message of the last election . 
we won a majority government , something that has not happened that often in this country . 
the people endorsed our programs . 
i would like the member , who has been thoughtful on these issues for some time , to step aside from the rhetoric that he has brought into this House from his research department and sit down and itemize for me on the record the cuts that he would make in order to do it differently . 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , I would hate to point out to the member that they won a majority government but with the smallest percentage of popular vote in Canadian history for a majority government . 
if that is not chastisement with a divided opposition , I do not know what is . 
we still see the Liberal arrogance creeping into that member ' s comments . 
we were very clear in our fresh start platform document about precisely which programs we thought were priorities and those that we thought could be cut . 
let us talk about some of this . 
how about eliminating grants and handouts to special interest groups whose sole purpose is to demand more government spending ? 
how about paring back some of the giveaway programs of the hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage , like her $ 23 million flag giveaway ? 
how about starting with the hon. members pension plan ? 
Mr. Speaker , 51 of 52 of my colleagues in the last Parliament gave up their pensions as a sign of sacrifice , as have many provincial legislators engaged in the same deficit cutting exercise . 
why don ' t my hon. friends start with the same kind of leadership by example ? 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all I would like to congratulate you on your appointment and I would like to congratulate the member on his election . 
it is unfortunate that there are not more members in the House today . 
it may be due to the fact that we keep hearing all the negativism . 
Canadians are fed up with negativism . 
clearly we point out to the member that his party not that long ago talked about the deficit as the number one issue in this country . 
maybe the member of the opposition went to the school of Orwellian politics , doublespeak . 
on the one hand , they want the deficit eliminated . 
now the deficit is being eliminated and they say " Well gee , we don ' t like the way this is being done '' . 
my comment is that in order to stimulate the economy , we had to get that deficit down , slay that $ 42 billion dragon . 
clearly there are more Canadians going back to work . 
clearly reducing taxes , yes , I think all Canadians would like to see taxes reduced . 
the question is the timing of those reductions basically because , if we are taking in more money in order to be able to deal with the deficit and certainly the debt - we have a $ 600 billion debt which I hope they would deal with - I would say that the hon. member talks about chequebook politics . 
could he explain to me what are the chequebook politics ? 
helping Canadians I believe is what the government is doing in the throne speech . 
maybe he should read that . 
could the member comment on what he defines as chequebook politics ? 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , talk about Orwellian rhetoric . 
my goodness , that is quite a question . 
the simple answer is yes , we did call for the elimination of the deficit and the reduction of the debt , not as an end in itself but as a means to an end . 
that end is greater prosperity , hope , growth and opportunity for Canadians through tax relief . 
you cannot provide Canadians with tax relief if you are spending the money instead of reducing it . 
it is a simple mathematical thing . 
perhaps you have never balanced a family budget . 
heaven knows this Liberal government has never balanced a government budget . 
but when you cut your spending , you get a surplus and that means that you can reduce people ' s taxes . 
that is why we have been pushing successive governments in this country since the Reform Party was founded a decade ago to get our finances under control so we could let Canadians keep more of their own money . 
it is not money that belongs to this Parliament or this government or the Liberal Party of Canada . 
it is money that belongs to Canadians and they ought to be able to keep it . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i regret to inform the large number of members who want to ask questions that the time for questions and comments has expired . 
the hon. member for Broadview - Greenwood on a point of order . 
Mr. Dennis J . Mills : 
Mr. Speaker , this member of Parliament , who has just arrived here , as we all know , is one of the foremost experts in the country on the whole issue of tax reform . 
i wonder if we could have the unanimous consent of the House to extend this period of questioning for a few more minutes because we cannot let him off this easy . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent to extend the time for questions and comments ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , thank you very much . 
i am happy to be here in the House for the member ' s maiden speech . 
one of the reasons why they failed to stick with this issue was because they talk about the tax grants to social organizations , but the real tax grants in this country are the tax expenditures that are buried in the 1,500 pages of the tax act and most of those tax grants go to large multinational organizations . 
i want to ask the member of Parliament for Calgary Southeast if he will undertake to make sure in this Parliament that he will champion eliminating all of those hidden unaccountable tax expenditures , especially those that go to the oil and gas industry in western Canada . 
i want him to make sure that he will stand in this House and champion that part of tax reform . 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for his kind words and extend some of my own . 
i have enormous respect for the hon. member for Broadview - Greenwood ' s long and principled crusade for tax reform in this country . 
he has been against the stream in his party and his government in calling for a single tax that would ultimately give Canadians what I advocate as well . 
would I support the elimination of all the so - called tax expenditures ? 
of course not because the single largest tax expenditure is the RRSP which most Canadians rely on for their retirement savings . 
there are of course tax preferences that some large companies have which I think are unreasonable in terms of creating a hugely complex tax system and which require tens of thousands of tax lawyers , accountants and bureaucrats at Revenue Canada at untold public expense to administer . 
however I think the solution is not to eliminate those things while keeping the same tax rates thereby squeezing more revenue out of the economy . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
are hon. members rising on questions or comments ? 
is it the wish of the House to continue with questions and comments in this case ? 
some hon. members : 
No. 
the Deputy Speaker : 
in fairness to the other members who are on the list to speak , I think it might be more prudent to continue with the debate . 
Ms. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) : 
i am both honoured and humbled by the support of the people of Kitchener Centre who have brought me here to Ottawa . 
as well , I would like to acknowledge and send good wishes to my predecessor , Dr. John English , who has moved on to new challenges while he continues his work on the anti - personnel landmine issue . 
it is the faith of Kitchener Centre in my ability to represent their best interests which has brought me to this historical seat of democracy to be a part of the historic second consecutive Liberal government , the last Parliament of the 20 th century and the one which will lead Canada into the next millennium . 
there are a couple of things I would like to share with the House this afternoon . 
first I would like everyone to know why I support the Speech from the Throne as presented by the governor general on the opening day of this Parliament . 
second I would like to offer the government an idea . 
it is an idea which builds on the agenda presented in the Speech from the Throne and one which would effect real change in the perception and effectiveness of government . 
it is important to recognize the foundations which were laid for Canada and Canadians by those who have sat in this House throughout the last century , those who have shaped Canada ' s identity from coast to coast and abroad . 
we are known for our Canadian values , generosity of spirit and collective action ; values which have set us apart in the areas of health care , foreign affairs and peacekeeping ; all those characteristics which lend to our pride in our country and the respect of the maple leaf worldwide . 
in addition to Canadian values , much of our success is based on at least four principles of Canadian liberalism as laid out by Sir Wilfrid Laurier . 
the first is faith in the individual , which implies freedom of the individual to make his or her own decisions within the constraints of a democratic society . 
the second principle is compassion for the underprivileged , a principle which is the underpinning of a social safety net which Canadians of all parties speak of with pride . 
third is the principle of tolerance toward individuals and groups . 
it is this principle which enabled Laurier and his successors to bridge the ethnic , racial and cultural differences which characterize Canada . 
the fourth principle is that of reform , pushing to develop new policies in keeping with changing times . 
the Speech from the Throne provided the vision as to how this government , the 36 th Parliament , will continue to act on these principles , and to ensure and work to enhance the quality of living we experience as Canadians . 
the theme of partnership permeated the Speech from the Throne ; partnership between governments , provincial , territorial and federal ; partnership between the public and private sector , large corporations , small businesses , communities and individuals ; partnerships which will provide a well - rounded , multifaceted approach to program development and delivery . 
i am pleased with the government ' s commitment to this type of collaboration as I believe it is important for the government to address issues on local and regional levels with the assistance of supporting organizations , businesses and government services . 
one of the outstanding characteristics of my riding is the high degree of volunteerism from the community and the willingness of the corporate sector to support both with personnel and funds the initiatives which the community values . 
it is the government ' s ability to draw on the strengths of our country ' s differences which will build a stronger Canada . 
Kitchener is fortunate to be a part of Canada ' s technology triangle comprised of high tech companies located in Kitchener - Waterloo , Cambridge and Guelph . 
the success of partnership in these areas demonstrates that no longer can any one group or sector effectively operate and succeed in isolation . 
this initiative has created a vehicle with which our area is able to compete in a global economy . 
as stated in the Speech from the Throne " one in three Canadian jobs depend on trade '' . 
in the last Parliament the government made progress in promoting trade both within our borders and beyond through reducing internal trade barriers and using the team Canada approach to open doors to Canadian businesses in Asia . 
a number of Kitchener area businesses which were represented on that mission have benefited from increased international demand . 
the success of this approach demonstrates what can be accomplished when governments and the private sector work together . 
i am pleased with the government ' s commitment to build on this success with a focused strategy . 
i am confident that upcoming team Canada missions will be as fruitful for Kitchener area businesses as well as others throughout Canada . 
by mounting these initiatives the government is providing fitting leadership which facilitates lasting job creation in the private sector . 
tourism plays a significant role in the economic mosiac of Kitchener and surrounding areas . 
many visitors , future residents and investors became acquainted with our community through tourism . 
Kitchener ' s rich ethnic diversity and cultural wealth have certainly aided the development of various industries including tourism . 
it is an excellent example of people taking pride in their heritage and working together for the benefit of the entire community . 
the associated economic benefits are in the millions of dollars and continue to grow each year . 
while Kitchener enjoys steady growth , the health of a community cannot be measured solely in economic terms . 
we must also recognize the areas which require attention : continued quality health care , reduced child poverty , improved community safety , lower unemployment and sustained economic growth . 
all these areas must be addressed without jeopardizing how far our government has come in getting our fiscal house in order . 
in the Speech from the Throne the government has offered a positive approach to these issues through strategic investments . 
i come to the 36 th Parliament with one agenda : to be the best representative I can be , to fulfil this role with energy and dignity , and to participate in the development and implementation of legislation that is good for all Canadians . 
the Speech from the Throne set the foundation for an exciting and fulfilling term . 
together we can bring a stronger , united Canada into the next millennium . 
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , at the onset I congratulate you on your well earned appointment . 
i also congratulate the hon. member on her maiden speech . 
the hon. member sang a hymn of praise to team Canada and told us about all the wonderful things that happened as a result of its overseas missions . 
the figures are in ; I am sure she is aware of them . 
our exports have dropped substantially to every area where there was a team Canada mission . 
this is a fact as presented in the government ' s own figures . 
if this is indeed the case , why is she so proud of the work of team Canada ? 
my second question , if she will be so kind as to address two of them , is with respect to internal trade barriers . 
she said the right things , that we have to bring down internal trade barriers . 
my question to her is when and how . 
the Government of Canada has the constitutional power to do this . 
we have a constitution that says that interprovincial trade must be free and open . 
Ms. Karen Redman : 
Mr. Speaker , I will reply to the two questions the hon. member has posed . 
the city of Kitchener was able to send a mayor on team Canada to the Pacific rim . 
as far as the internal trade barriers are concerned , I mentioned in my comments about partnership . 
we have to acknowledge that when we share a vision we have to let the partner help shape it . 
i have every confidence the government will get where it needs to be . 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier ( Manicouagan , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , once again , I have listened carefully to what the hon. member had to say , and like all her colleagues , she did not mention the people of Quebec ' s interest . 
i think this is important , and I wish to pursue the point , because when I came to Ottawa , to this House , I came with my head held high , because the people of Quebec elected us . 
we represent 60 per cent of the members from Quebec , and we have a sovereignist government in Quebec City with whom we share the same option and which holds 80 per cent of the seats there . 
those of you who believe the polls , who try to say that we are not legitimate and that the people of Quebec do not want sovereignty , are in for some surprises . 
i have two questions for the member who just spoke . 
i would like to know if she admits that the government ' s legislative program denies the existence of the people of Quebec and of their culture ? 
Ms. Karen Redman : 
Mr. Speaker , I acknowledge that one of the exciting parts of coming to the House of Parliament and this democratic process steeped in history was to be able to brush elbows with people in all parts of Canada . 
my Canada includes Quebec . It is a vibrant , thriving society . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate my colleague from Kitchener Centre not only on her maiden speech but also on her excellent replies . 
it is very difficult to come into the House and suddenly face opposition questions . 
it will be difficult to follow that act , as it were , but I will try to do my very best . 
we are one of the most accountable people in the land simply because if the people of Canada , the electorate , do not like us or are not satisfied with us they can fire us every four or five years , or whatever the case may be . 
they can fire us nonetheless . 
the Reform Party and hopefully some of the new parties might bear that in mind . 
the other point is that the member for Calgary Southwest probably meant we should be seeking more accountability from government machinery . 
all MPs on all sides of the House share this responsibility . 
we express this responsibility by the questions we pose in committee . 
i spent some time on the government operations committee when we scrutinized a number of departments and found a number of flaws . 
many of the flaws were due to a lack of accountability . 
i am quite happy to say that the search for better government was not exclusively Liberal . 
it was predominantly Liberal , but I was assisted by my colleagues , members of the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois . 
as MPs we are accountable . 
it is the machinery of government we must scrutinize . 
reform Party members certainly have no exclusivity on the desire to bring accountability to government and to reform government . 
just because they have the name Reform in their party title does not mean they are the only MPs who seek reform . 
the member for Calgary Southwest also criticized the Speech from the Throne because it devolved certain responsibilities that were once federal to the provinces . 
the member for Calgary Southwest complained this devolution was done purely for administrative means . 
he said that his party , were it in power , would have passed a bill and made these changes statutory . 
he is referring to transferring certain responsibilities for forestry , social housing , mining and several other issues to the provinces . 
i remind members opposite that Ontario is experiencing the consequences of transferring power , that is the power to control the responsibility for social housing . 
what happens when it is given to a provincial government that does not have the same spirit of generosity and caring as the federal government ? 
now it is devolving it to the municipalities . 
the lesson for us is that we ought to make sure that when we transfer federal powers we transfer them in a way in which we can take them back if we need do so . 
that is the situation in Ontario . 
more unfortunate in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition was that he suggested transfers of responsibilities should be done by statutes . 
when he says that , because he is talking about provincial and federal powers , he can only mean changes to the Constitution . 
it is the last thing Canadians want . 
i am absolutely amazed the Leader of the Opposition should propose going into the Constitution again . 
all I can say is good luck . 
look at what happened to a former Conservative prime minister . 
i have to come to the Speech from the Throne . 
i am sorry , but I found it a bit uninspiring . 
i think that the throne speech lacked eloquence and inspiration . 
the ideas are good , they are all good , but the speech did not have what I was looking for . 
fortunately the next day the Prime Minister spoke on the Speech from the Throne , and I found his remarks full of eloquence and ideas . 
i found him eloquent on the subject of the government ' s ideas . 
i especially like the idea in the prime minister ' s remarks of supporting young people . 
i have to tell the House that I wanted to see the Speech from the Throne talk about citizenship , getting rid of the monarchy and a number of other things . 
he mentioned that when he was young he remembers sitting in kitchens in Saskatchewan , shooting pool in Newfoundland and that kind of thing . 
i was inspired . 
it is beautiful country . 
any Reform MP who is from the Rockies or the prairies should be proud of it . 
i have become a federalist with my heart in the mountains and in the province of Quebec , because of that . 
i think the prime minister is right on when he said that the new Parliament and the Speech from the Throne , even though it did not express it very well , but he expressed it so much better , should be about the future generation , the new generation of Canadians , Canada ' s young people . 
i would like to conclude with a quote . 
the prime minister said this part of his speech in English and so with a certain amount of pride and perhaps trepidation I will attempt to say the prime minister ' s words in French . 
here is what he said and I do not think I could say it better . 
he said : 
we have built that nation and we continue to shape its elements . 
our young will do so in the next century . 
their architecture will be new but it will be Canadian . 
greatness may have a different meaning , but it will still be Canadian . 
that is the essence of the Speech from the Throne . 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to bring to the attention of the House the member ' s comments and his criticisms against the member for Calgary Southeast . 
he was quite critical of the member when he was referring to accountability in suggesting that he has an exclusive on accountability and suggesting that the Liberal Party can be just as accountable and its members can as well . 
i would like to remind the member that it is very easy to speak of accountability but the Reform Party has an absolute exclusivity on actions when it comes to accountability . 
that is the only way he is going to be able to show the Canadian people accountability , through actions like giving up his pension . 
Mr. John Bryden : 
Mr. Speaker , as an individual member I would like to refer the member opposite to some of my efforts with respect to bringing accountability to charitable organizations which , in a sense , are government organizations in the sense that they receive taxpayer dollars . 
i think the member for Calgary Southwest should have recognized that he was criticizing MPs as MPs rather than criticizing the government . 
he got a little confused there , if you will . 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first I wish to congratulate you on your appointment . 
you are one of the Reform Party members with whom I have had the opportunity to work . 
what I want to ask the hon. member is whether he admits that the federal government is about to get fully involved in areas under provincial jurisdiction . 
Mr. Speaker , you will remember that the national conference on youth and the new economy had young participants from everywhere , including eastern and western Canada , Quebec and other regions of the country . 
these people from every region of the country told us that these youth initiatives , these employment initiatives must be implemented , to the extent possible , where the problems are , namely in the regions . 
in other words , we must take measures that are appropriate to the specific problems of the regions . 
upon reading the throne speech , one cannot help but conclude that the federal government is trying to get involved in areas under provincial jurisdiction and to enhance its visibility . 
i have a question for the hon. member . 
what does the federal government have to gain from getting involved in areas under provincial jurisdiction ? 
Mr. John Bryden : 
Mr. Speaker , in my opinion it is simple . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to start , first of all , by thanking the people of T é miscouata who supported me for three and a half years during my first term . 
for the information of the hon. member opposite , as a result of electoral reform , T é miscouata is now part of the riding of Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , represented by our colleague , Paul Cr ê te . 
i now wish to take this opportunity to thank the people of Rimouski - Mitis for giving me their support . 
Mr. Speaker , I realize you have already visited our lovely region and enjoyed the beauty of the St. Lawrence and our forests . 
i happen to live in one of Quebec ' s many beautiful regions , but this one is particularly attractive , in my opinion . 
unfortunately , the government is not really working for the people . 
it would rather perpetuate the doctrine of Pierre Elliott Trudeau , who advocated a dominating and centralizing federal government and would not recognize the identity and aspirations of the people of Quebec . 
Lester B . Pearson ' s legacy has completely disappeared . 
i will remind the House that Mr. Pearson had asked that the Laurendeau - Dunton Commission recommend steps to ensure that the Canadian confederation would develop in accordance with the principle of two equal founding peoples . 
those days are really gone now . 
of course , in the eyes of the Liberal government , there is no such thing as a Quebec culture . 
in fact , the Prime Minister once said there is only one , Canadian culture , which may be of French or English expression . 
the Speech from the Throne may talk about a " tolerant and highly diverse society '' , but the government still fails to recognize the basic historical fact that Quebec is one of the founding peoples of this country . 
the vacuum is particularly noticeable in the area of cultural development . 
this lack of vision and commitment is sad for Quebec as well as for Canada . 
Quebec however has a way out : relaim all its powers and achieve sovereignty in a hurry . 
during the 35 th Parliament , the government demonstrated that culture was not one of its major concerns . 
it contented itself with micro - managing seriously reduced budgets . 
in addition to cutting back funding , it did nothing to encourage culture . 
it has taken the relentless efforts of the Bloc Quebecois to persuade the Liberals finally to bring in copyright reform . 
in its speech , the government says it wants to make it possible for Canadian culture to reach audiences abroad . 
we can only hope that this intention will take the form of support for creators and cultural industries . 
we do not want to see a repeat of last year ' s attempts to force artists to promote Canadian unity , or to judge projects on the basis of political rather than artistic criteria , or to require artists to pay a visit to the member for Verdun , whom they did not know and had never met , in order to collect their cheque . 
the government speaks proudly of our films . 
what it should do is conduct an in - depth review of Telefilm Canada ' s film policy , which was seriously criticized in an internal report . 
one of the things this report mentions is an overall lack of funding - cuts of $ 84 million do not go unnoticed in a budget - as well as shortcomings in marketing , and distribution problems . 
Telefilm Canada has its work cut out for it . 
if the government truly wants to reflect social and linguistic diversity , it should stop censoring artistic projects that deal with the history or culture of Quebec , as it did with Pierre Falardeau ' s plans for a film about the life of the Patriot Delorimier , entitled Le 15 f é vrier 1839 . 
the most vital criterion should be script quality . 
the decision making process ought to be free of any conflict of interest or political partisanship , which was not the case with Mr. Falardeau ' s production , as we now have all the evidence we need to prove . 
if the government still does nothing in this area , fewer and fewer books with Canadian content will be published , because our entire industry will have been sold out to the Americans . 
in this area , the anglophone culture is more vulnerable than the francophone . 
the government must react to the World Trade Organization decision on split runs of American periodicals . 
the Minister of Heritage had , moreover , made a commitment to present a plan in support of the magazine publishing industry as soon as Parliament reconvened . 
is she going to stick to that campaign promise , or will she be forced to resign a second time ? 
watch for the next instalment . 
the Minister of Heritage will need to find ways of supporting the periodicals and scientific and cultural periodicals which are being seriously threatened by the reduced postal subsidy and the changes in its rules . 
i must point out that , in this area , there is a particular threat to specialized French language periodicals , given their limited market . 
in the Speech from the Throne , there is also a reference to videos . 
if the government really wants to develop this industry and encourage creativity , it must immediate review the Copyright Act , for the audiovisual sector was excluded from the recent revision of that legislation . 
a guarantee of receiving the revenues generated by their work would be the best way to stimulate creators and craftspeople in this area of cultural activity . 
in the same vein , the $ 45 million in cuts made by the Liberal government have resulted in the National Film Board ' s virtually abandoning its assistance to independent film making , and this particularly jeopardizes the careers of the young film and video makers who represent the future of their industry . 
we read in the Speech from the Throne that the government , and I quote " will provide increased support to the Canada Council '' . 
now that is really playing with words to mislead us in this area too . 
here as elsewhere , the government will probably be content to give back some of the funding it cut in the past . 
there will have to be a number of years of Liberal generosity before the Canada Council returns to the level of funding it enjoyed before the Liberals came to power . 
as Liberal spending power is legendary , the government will announce straight faced and glowing with pride the ever increasing budget of the Canada Council . 
regarding the information highway , the government talks of the urgency of making Canada " the most connected nation in the world '' . 
we have seen how that could help in consultations on certain declarations , because a number of provinces are contemplating using the connection from Industry Canada . 
being " connected " is a praiseworthy objective . 
however , the Speech from the Throne makes no mention of the promise of the second red book to create a $ 15 million multimedia fund and fails to act on the recommendation of the advisory committee on the information highway that a $ 50 million , and not $ 15 million , fund be set up . 
will the Minister of Industry be the only one overseeing Canada ' s information highway , disregarding its cultural and education sides ? 
this is another subject to follow . 
we read in the speech that " A connected nation is more than wires , cables and computers '' . 
what a discovery . 
" it is a nation in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need '' . 
we agree . 
this is why the Bloc Quebecois has insisted for nearly four years now on the need to develop francophone content for the information highway . 
there are gaping holes in this speech . 
in their first red book , the Liberals were committed to stable multi - year financing for the CBC . 
every budget in the past four years has broken this promise , and the corporation has had to absorb $ 350 million in cuts . 
should we be alarmed by the fact that the speech does not mention the CBC ? 
when it was promised stable financing , it actually got cuts . 
this time , it is not even mentioned . 
does this mean that its financing will be maintained , cut , or that it will again benefit from the government ' s largesse ? 
on this , we will have to wait and see . 
is the government finally going to give equal treatment to the French and the English networks ? 
at present , one hour of programming costs on average $ 37,500 on the English network and $ 18,390 on the French network . 
the government should stop treating francophones as second class citizens , and set up two autonomous corporations with equivalent budgets based on the same cost per hour of programming . 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew : 
per hour of programming ? 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay : 
yes , sir . 
before the last federal election , the health minister promised amendments to the tobacco control bill to allow sponsorship of sporting events . 
since there is no mention of this in the throne speech , are we to understand that the government has already forgotten its promise ? 
what will happen to cultural events in danger of losing their sponsors as a result of this bill ? 
at issue is the potential loss of some $ 30 million in economic benefits these major cultural and sporting events generate in Quebec , mainly in Montreal . 
is the Liberal government once again going to abandon the cultural sector ? 
one of the few promising aspects of this speech is the federalist propaganda campaign . 
we are told they are going to rev it up as we approach the new millennium . 
the government is not interested in how useful or effective these programs will be . 
what matters to the government is to be visible with its flag . 
it must be noted that on July 1 , the government did not hesitate to take down our flag from our Parliament to replace it with the Queen ' s standard to show how dominated we are . 
where does this idea of visibility over effectiveness come from ? 
a national image must be created that will have such an appeal as to make any image of a separatist group unattractive '' . 
the Liberals are obviously inspired by this ideology . 
now the only thing that matters to the government is to create an image , an illusion . 
while people are getting poorer and poorer and while the government refuses to recognize Quebec ' s identity , it will create the illusion of wealth and the illusion of the acceptation of Quebec by the outstretched hand that actually just wants to crush us and bring us down to our knees . 
we must remember that the money we receive is our own money . 
it comes from our taxes . 
the federal government does not have a penny . 
it gets its money from the Canadian taxpayers and does not own it , although it may think it does . 
the federal government can start spending once again only because it keeps on cutting social programs and transfers to provinces and because it diverts the unemployment insurance fund from its intended purpose . 
the money belongs to us and not to the government . 
it wants to use it to serve its own interests and improve its visibility , not to ensure our development . 
the Bloc Quebecois will never stop calling for the federal government to stop useless and unwarranted spending for propaganda purposes . 
you will be surprised when we reveal these figures . 
the sums are really huge . 
the amounts recovered in these ways should be spent on cultural activities and on promoting freedom of artistic expression . 
take a good look at Statistics Canada ' s figures . 
you will see , in black and white , that the increase went to operating expenditures and capital expenditures and that it was used for severance packages given to employees laid off by the department and its agencies and not for the promotion of cultural endeavour . 
in concluding , the strategies contained in the Speech from the Throne are basically aimed at restoring the tarnished reputation of this federal government and giving it a semblance of relevance . 
this the government intends to do by using money cut from transfers to the provinces for health , education and welfare and money saved at the expense of ordinary citizens : the unemployed , workers , seasonal workers , the sick , students and welfare recipients . 
instead of concentrating on rebuilding what it had destroyed , the federal government has embarked on new intrusions in areas under provincial jurisdiction . 
it is triumphant , carefully disguising the fact that we can expect at least $ 42 billion more in cuts between now and the year 2001 . 
concealment is definitely the name of the game for this government . 
however , Quebecers are nobody ' s fool . 
when the time comes for them to determine their future , they will realize there is no risk involved in having one own ' s country and being sovereign , in exchanging the maple leaf for a fleur de lys , since all the money will stay in Quebec and be used to meet their own needs . 
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) : 
thank you , Mr. Speaker , for recognizing me . 
i hope that we are able to see many more of these emotional discussions . 
instead of ranting and raving for the benefit of the cameras , instead of turning this into a public circus and saying things like the federal government is destroying something it has built , perhaps the hon. member would entertain a constructive suggestion . 
how about starting on a policy , a movement for the purpose of building a good country , a country like Canada , the best country in the world to live in . 
i was interested in the hon. member ' s comments to the effect that she was very worried about cultural problems . 
we all know that people who work in the cultural industries , especially in certain provinces , have a political agenda . 
i am not particularly interested in all that . 
my interest extends to the work I did in committee last year . 
the hon. member was on the same committee . 
i find not only depressing but sad that they do not realize the harm they are doing to others , outside Quebec , who do not share their interests . 
i would like the member to respond to that , if she can . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay : 
the hon. member opposite has some nerve , Mr. Speaker . 
first , I suggest he reread my speech over at leisure . 
he will realize , after reading his own remarks , that he did not understand what I said . 
i have never said that we were the only francophones - 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew : 
don ' t be arrogant . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay : 
Mr. Speaker , would you ask the minister to be quiet ? 
he is carrying on . 
i think this is an important point . 
we never claimed to be the only ones who speak French in Canada . 
i never said such a thing . 
we have followed with interest the situation in Ontario . 
we have seen what happened with Montfort Hospital . 
we have seen Mrs. Lalonde resign from her position as chair of S . O . S . Montfort . 
why ? 
because the City of Vanier voted in favour of partition . 
so they reconsidered their position and decided it was such a mistake to support partition that now Vanier would almost go as far as to support Quebec ' s sovereignty . 
you know , the hon. member opposite is in no position to criticize us . 
he used to be the member for Ontario ; that was easy enough to remember , but I forget what his new riding is called . 
an hon. member : 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay : 
there is " Ajax " in there and , to me , that is stuff used to clean the sink . 
some hon. members : 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay : 
that is the kind of trick I will use to remember the name of his riding in future . 
naturally , we all have our own personality . 
i for one am a passionate person . 
he should watch the program on the French network of the CBC this evening , at 7.30 p.m. He would get to know me better because tonight is about who I am really , behind the image . 
this is an invitation . 
however , he will realize that I am a passionate person , and I am not about to set this aspect of my personality aside just because it does not please the Liberals . 
if there is something I intend to do , it is to show passion in this House . 
Mr. Eug è ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to comment on the speech by the hon. member for Rimouski - Mitis . 
first , I must congratulate her for a very passionate and good speech , in which she defends culture . 
the hon. member has always been known to defend culture and I congratulate her for doing so . 
when the hon. member refers to us , francophones from outside Quebec , it is always in a negative way and I deplore that . 
i do not think she does it out of malice but , rather , out of separatist idealism to try to make a point . 
she should instead encourage francophones outside Quebec and show what is happening among French Canadians . 
the hon. member talked about Quebec ' s culture . 
there is a French Canadian culture . 
there are many cultivated people in Quebec . 
there is a thriving culture , but francophones living outside Quebec also contribute to that culture . 
when she talks about the francophonie , I wish the member for Rimouski - Mitis would include francophones outside Quebec as well as those in Quebec in Canada ' s French - speaking community . 
perhaps I should commend her for her interest in this matter . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his kind words , of course . 
i am flattered . 
first of all , in my speech , which I also invite this member to read , I never excluded francophones outside Quebec . 
i asked whether there would be an information highway for francophones . 
i did not specify that it would be for Quebec alone and that it would not go outside our province . 
the information highway covers quite a distance . 
i would have a lot of trouble stopping it at the Quebec border . 
i spoke about an information highway for francophones , meaning all francophones in Canada . 
i have no objection to there being a French Canadian people . 
but I am no longer part of that group . 
when I was growing up , I was taught in school that I was a French Canadian . 
later on , I was told that I was a Quebecer and I like that better . 
but I will not be faulted for preferring to be a Quebecer to being a French Canadian . 
as a French Canadian , I am a second class citizen . 
as a Quebecer , I am a first class citizen . 
that is the difference . 
i have no objection to their being French Canadians , but why are we given less money to produce television programs ? 
Mr. Eug è ne Bellemare : 
Mr. Speaker , I am referring to the Canadian Constitution . 
French Canadians are not second class citizens , as the member has just said . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
with the greatest of respect , as the hon. member knows that is most likely a point of debate . 
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Algoma - Manitoulin , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first let me offer my congratulations to you on your new office . 
we are all confident you will do a great job . 
let me also say that I am sharing my time with the hon. member for St. Catharines . 
i am very pleased to participate in this debate . 
there is no question the Speech from the Throne we heard this past Tuesday speaks for itself . 
nonetheless we are here , opposition members from one point of view and government members from another , to debate the merits or demerits of the throne speech . 
the fact I am here as the member for Algoma - Manitoulin is due to the voters of my riding who expressed their support in me . 
i appreciate that . 
we all had supporters among our volunteers and our loved ones . 
on behalf of all of us may I thank many people across the country who participated in the political process , in the democratic process . 
they are helping to make this country the greatest country in the world with a parliament that at times seems to be raucous and noisy but a parliament that works , a parliament in which we can all have confidence . 
if they serve their constituents and their country well , they will feel the reward of knowing that the country is bit by bit moving positively into the next millennium . 
it is appropriate that a Liberal government will lead the country into the next millennium . 
our Prime Minister is the right person to lead the government into the next thousand years . 
we demonstrated in the last Parliament - and we will show it again - that this is an open , transparent government , a government that will listen to the people and will make decisions , often tough decisions , that are needed to continue keeping the country the best country in the world . 
in my time around here as the member of Parliament for Algoma - Manitoulin I have learned that ultimately voters want to know their governments and representatives care about them and their communities . 
the less we express and show that , the more distant they feel . 
my riding in northern Ontario stretches from Manitouwadge in the northwest to Chapleau in the northeast and south to the north shore of Lake Huron including Manitoulin Island . 
the throne speech expresses the caring nature of the government . 
we can find no greater evidence than in the words of the throne speech . 
let us start with the issue of the economy . 
in the last Parliament a tremendous challenge was facing us with the deficit at record levels . 
what greater thing can we do for preserving our health care programs , our pension programs , programs for youth and so on , than by ensuring our economy is strong and vibrant based on a set of books we can all be proud of whether a member of the opposition or not . 
that essence of caring has given Canadians for the first time in a long time a real sense of hope , optimism and confidence about the future . 
we are certainly not there yet when it comes to solving all the problems of the country . 
there will always be challenges and problems to face . 
it has been a long time since this country has been at such a tremendous juncture in its history . 
in fact there is so much confidence as we approach the next millennium that the Prime Minister in the throne speech announced that we are going to have a tremendous millennium party in two and a half years , a party which I believe the world will come to because people around the world know that we have a country that cares about people . 
even though we hear complaints from different parts of the country it is only because people know that the government will listen when they speak and cry out for help . 
they know we will respond . 
a caring government must look at the first and most important group in our society , our children . 
we have recognized that children must get a good start in life , be it through proper nutrition or through proper education . 
when it comes to the young people of our society , people who we worry a lot about because of their concerns of future employment , this government in the last Parliament , and even more this Parliament , stands ready to make sure that in co - operation with the provinces through an enhanced scholarship program , through initiatives with industry it can make sure that they have a chance at that first job , at starting life on the right foot . 
if , for some reason , they get off on the wrong foot we are there to make sure they have a second and a third chance if necessary . 
we are also looking out for those in our society who find themselves in the middle ages , sometimes victims of structural change . 
with changing societies and economies , we will see jobs lost here and jobs created somewhere else . 
that is the nature of our modern society . 
we have the sadness which comes with losing a job maybe at the age of 40 or 50 years of age . 
many of my constituents have faced that challenge , particularly in Elliot Lake . 
it is incumbent on us to continue to assist people caught in this way with retraining or appropriate early retirement programs . 
for the final age category , that being our elderly , what more can a government do but to make sure that the pension systems are secure and that seniors do not have to worry about the future . 
i heard from the seniors . 
they were worried about the future . 
when they understood through our campaign that we were committed to securing the Canada pension plan for the future and that we were developing the seniors benefit plan , they knew that the government would be watching out for them . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member for Algoma referred to the strong voice of the government that is there for the people . 
that strong voice just was not there . 
it was a silent voice for the people in Atlantic Canada in the last Parliament . 
Atlantic Canada has 8 percent of the population and it was taking 27 percent of all the cuts . 
i have a shipyard , the most modern shipyard there is in Canada , in Saint John , New Brunswick . 
four thousand men used to work there . 
none are working there now . 
the government is selling off all the housing of CMHC . 
do you know who lives in CMHC housing ? 
all the low and middle income people live in those houses . 
when you privatize it , the rent doubles and triples and the people are out on the street . 
i do not believe that the government understands what it has done . 
it is time for it to stop and take a look . 
the member talks about a crack . 
what is in the throne speech is a crack the size of the Grand Canyon . 
i appeal to the government to please tell us what it is going to do for the people who are hurting like never before . 
i do not want to hear about governments in the past who did this or that . 
all I know is that when I was mayor our people worked and we had a low unemployment rate . 
i had 4,000 people working at my shipyard , some as plumbers , some as electricians . 
it was beautiful . 
however , right now it is a total disaster . 
please tell me what you are going to do for our people ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i would remind hon. members to please address each other through the Chair . 
Mr. Brent St. Denis : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the remarks of the hon. member for Saint John . 
i admire the member for Saint John . 
she was very effective in the last Parliament and I expect that she will be in this Parliament . 
however , I believe she is missing the point . 
in the last Parliament the government had to make some tough decisions . 
you can care about the people and still make tough decisions knowing that what you are doing will be better for all the regions of the country . 
in my home town of Elliot Lake , starting in 1990 we experienced a job loss of some 5,000 in the uranium mining industry . 
there was a lot of adjustment , but in the long run the changes which took place have shown that Elliot Lake and that region will survive and do very well . 
i know that the spirit of the citizens of the Atlantic provinces is very much the same . 
they will respond to change and they will deal with the challenges that face them in a very creative way . 
i have every confidence in the citizens of Saint John and the other ridings of the Atlantic provinces . 
they will take up the flag and march into the next millennium with all of us . 
all of our regions will be better off with the changes and improvements that we have made in the governance of this country . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate you . 
i would like to refer to the speech we have just heard from the hon. member for Algoma - Manitoulin . 
he used little phrases in his comment that really caught my attention . 
i would like to ask the member for Algoma - Manitoulin what he considers to be accountability and what he considers being left behind . 
i draw his attention to the the allocation or awarding by the Minister of Industry of TPC grants . 
it is is clearly the spoken intention of the Minister of Industry to say very clearly that these grants are to be in support of and to develop small industry in Canada . 
what do we discover ? 
does he call that accountability ? 
does he call that being left behind ? 
what is he talking about ? 
Mr. Brent St. Denis : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate what I think was a question from the member for Kelowna . 
if he can check the blues , I believe he will appreciate my clarification on the people in our society who are being left behind . 
none of us in the House wants anyone to be left behind . 
i believe I said that this government in the last Parliament and again in this Parliament will take steps to ensure that as much as possible no one is left behind . 
i doubt that we will ever live in a perfect world , but we can all work together to make it a better world and a better country . 
i know that opposition members of all parties will work with us to make Canada a better and better place in which to live where no one will be left behind . 
that is not a fantasy nor is it a dream . 
it is a very high goal that will take a lot of effort and time to achieve . 
i believe the programs that we have and will put in place will provide our citizens with the very best possibility to achieve their own individual successes in life . 
take for example the scholarship fund that the Prime Minister referred to yesterday in his speech , the details of which will no doubt come out over the days and weeks ahead . 
it is a scholarship fund designed specifically for post - secondary aspirants who find themselves in low and modest income family situations . 
that among many initiatives is an indication of the government ' s commitment to those who might otherwise be left behind . 
while he might want to say that I said we were there , he knows full well it is an objective that will be best achieved through the efforts of this government no doubt with the co - operation of the opposition parties . 
the Speaker : 
it is now 6.15 p.m. and we are out of time . 
perhaps we can come back to this next time . 
it being 6.15 , it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith all questions necessary to dispose of the motion now before the House . 
the question is on the subamendment . 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the subamendment ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
the Speaker : 
all those in favour of the subamendment will please say yea . 
some hon. members : 
yea . 
the Speaker : 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
some hon. members : 
nay . 
the Speaker : 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
and more than five members having risen :

resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , it is a great pleasure for me to rise in the House today to speak for the first time in the 36 th Parliament and to talk about what is important to this session of Parliament and Canadians . 
first and most important I want to take this opportunity to thank my constituents , the people of St. Catharines , for choosing me to represent them here in the nation ' s capital in the House of Commons once again . 
i remind my colleagues , both new and old , that we are representatives of Canadians like those in St. Catharines who have concerns about jobs , about health care , about their children and grandchildren . 
my riding of St. Catharines is known as the garden city . 
we have gentler winters and warmer summers than we have here in the nation ' s capital and that is why our tender fruit is so sweet and our wine is just right . 
it also makes for good times for watching the ships slide through the Welland canal or to go rowing on Martindale pond , the future site of the 1999 world rowing championships . 
in addition to thanking my constituents for their continued support I want to warmly welcome the new members to the House . 
i am also honoured to stand before you as the recently appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry . 
i see this not only as a challenge but as a wonderful opportunity to work with all my colleagues in this House , to help Canadian businesses to succeed , to help them grow to create jobs and to make Canada the best country in the world . 
the Speech from the Throne , which we are debating today , marks the next stage in our government ' s commitment to work with Canadians and Canadian businesses to create and seize opportunities in the global knowledge based economy . 
canada ' s solid economic foundation is something that we put in place with the help and sacrifice of many Canadians . 
i want to remind the House that over the last four years we have also been working hard to promote innovation , advance the information highway , increase trade and create opportunities for Canadians in the new economy . 
i take this opportunity to outline some of our recent initiatives in the industry portfolio and how we will continue to improve the various department endeavours . 
over the last four years we have been getting Canadians connected and putting them on the information highway . 
this strategy calls for a high quality , low cost information network that will give Canadians access to employment information , education , health care , entertainment , investment and wealth creating opportunities in the technology sector . 
the strategy seeks to promote job creation through innovation and investment , reinforce Canadian cultural sovereignty and identity and to ensure that we have universal access to the information highway wherever we are in Canada . 
for example , the Strategis program and Industry Canada ' s on - line business information service have been demonstrated to business owners and managers at special events throughout this country at trade and information shows . 
almost 13 million documents have been accessed through Strategis , which is available to Canadians instantly on the Internet . 
the community access program is designed to connect rural and remote areas and aboriginal communities to the Internet . 
as stated in our throne speech , the mandate before 2001 is to connect well over 5,000 rural communities across Canada to the Internet to help them to get information at home or at their business . 
the SchoolNet program will encourage the connection of some 16,500 schools , 3,400 libraries and 450 first nation schools to the Internet by the end of 1998 - 99 . 
for everyone ' s information , well over 9,500 schools and 1,200 public libraries have been connected . 
each day across this country new libraries are being connected to this excellent program . 
another program called computers for schools redirects surplus computer equipment to schools and public libraries throughout the country . 
to date close to 40,000 computers and 60,000 software packages have been delivered to schools across this country . 
the student connection program hires university and college students to teach small businesses how to use the Internet because everybody needs to get on line and it takes time and effort for each of these businesses to do what has to be done in the new economy . 
it helps them improve their competitiveness and create new opportunities . 
in my province alone , Ontario , well over 2,200 firms have been assisted by our students to be connected to the Internet . 
in addition , the industry portfolio has been working to realize our international potential . 
the department has been working with its many partners to help existing exporters identify and access new trading opportunities and provide at the same time perspective exporters with the information , the skills and the tools they need to be export ready . 
we have a number of international trade centres across this country , including one in my province , the one in Toronto . 
it serves as a focal point for the delivery of market information , counselling and other support to potential exporters across the province . 
in 1996 the centre responded to well over 10,000 requests . 
in addition , Industry Canada and foreign affairs have established an active networks of trained executives across the country , those people who can assist small businesses , in fact any businesses , whether home business or even large businesses , in export . 
the National Research Council ' s industrial research assistance program has been helping SMEs right across this country . 
IRAP helps members of Parliament in their ridings to help their businesses which then create jobs . 
in my area of Niagara where we have some 31 cottage wineries a partnership with IRAP has created a special wine industry , known worldwide , receiving many medals . 
that was an initiative with IRAP , the grape growers and the wine industry . 
later next month we will be opening up an oenology and viticulture institute at Brock University , an excellent endeavour for the university , its students , its grape growers and the wine industry . 
many of our universities across Canada participate in networks of centres of excellence where they link together and work together for research and development . 
this area will be improved and will be continually supported by this government because of the excellent work that has been going on . 
i should also point out that the Canada community investment program has been an endeavour which 20 communities across this country , and all provinces and territories have at least one , have been using to improve access to capital . 
this is another area where we must continue on to help those communities that do not have major banking centres and financial centres but which need access to capital . 
i believe , as set out in the throne speech , that consumer confidence is growing and new businesses have been created . 
there is much work to do with all of us working together in our communities , our ridings , for the betterment of our country . 
it will be my endeavour to work with as many members in this House and companies and communities across this country in assistance to the Minister of Industry to make sure that we are continuing on the right track to help us grow as a country . 
i have outlined many initiatives pertaining to people , innovators , businesses and communities at work across this country . 
i believe the Speech from the Throne is a framework to lead our country into the 21 st century , and the good news is that much of our work is already well under way . 
we must continue to work at it in this mandate . 
i want to thank you , Madam Speaker , and again congratulate you on your appointment . 
i am sure many of us will have many discussions with you in the next four years . 
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) : 
many areas in justice should have been addressed in the throne speech but were not . 
we could look at the need for the reform of the Young Offenders Act , the elimination of the faint hope clause , exempting violent offenders from conditional sentencing and , of course , a victims ' bill of rights . 
these are all issues of great concern to Canadians and issues which Reform intend to pursue with vigour in this session of Parliament . 
according to a July 1997 Angus Reid poll , 52 % of Canadians have lost faith in our courts and our justice system . 
this is a serious matter . 
why have so many Canadians lost faith in our justice system and particularly our courts ? 
in an attempt to protect his close friend from embarrassment , Ted Thompson telephoned Chief Justice Isaac to warn him of the proposed supreme court reference . 
the chief justice of the federal court and Judge Jerome ' s administrative superior arranged for Mr. Thompson to meet with him in his chambers to discuss the matter further . 
an exchange of letters ensued in which Thompson outlined the chronology of the court delays on the three cases . 
this was all done without the knowledge of defence counsel . 
chief Justice Isaac then called Judge Jerome to a meeting and advised him of the threat of a supreme court reference if the pace of the hearings into the three deportation cases did not pick up . 
with Judge Jerome ' s assistance , Chief Justice Isaac responded to Mr. Thompson ' s letter assuring the assistant deputy the cases would be expedited . 
" i have discussed your concerns with the associate chief justice and like me he is prepared to take all reasonable steps possible to avoid a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada on these matters . " 
this too was done without the knowledge of defence counsel . 
following this horrendous act of interference into the judicial independence of Judge Jerome , justice department officials sought to minimize the damage by deliberately creating a false scenario designed to mislead defence counsel and Canadians into believing that Ted Thompson has approached Chief Justice Isaac for the innocent purpose of discussing the scheduling of 12 future deportation cases and had inadvertently discussed the three deportation cases being handled by Judge Jerome . 
in an effort to cover up this deceit , these justice officials recognized the need to keep Ted Thompson from testifying when a motion for a stay of proceedings was entered on the basis of political interference into the judicial independence of the court . 
this deceit and the object of deceit is revealed in secret justice department documents which justice officials were ordered to file in the Supreme Court of Canada . 
one of these documents is a memo to Mr. John Sims , the assistant deputy attorney general responsible for citizenship and immigration dated May 10 , 1996 , from Mr. Chris Amerasinghe , senior general counsel for the Attorney General of Canada . 
Mr. Amerasinghe states in his memo that if Ted Thompson testified in court " The damage done to the image of the department , the attorney general and the court will be incalculable for all time and the consequences could be far reaching , going far beyond the immediate concern for these three cases . 
it could precipitate the resignations of the minister and the chief justice . 
more importantly , the reputation of the government and the court will be irreparably damaged if all the evidence were to come out . " 
in a second memo dated May 12 , 1996 Mr. Amerasinghe states : 
justice officials were not the only ones who advised Thompson not to testify . 
during a private conversation in Montreal in early May , Judge Jerome provided Thompson with the same legal advice , not to submit an affidavit . 
chief Justice Isaac was at the same Montreal rules committee meeting , again an unbelievable revelation . 
as unbelievable as this is , Mr. Amerasinghe clearly and accurately describes the story being put forward by the justice department as false and a cover up , and this assessment is not denied by any justice official in the documents filed with the Supreme Court of Canada . 
the former justice minister is here parroting the false story and cover up detailed by Mr. Amerasinghe in a secret memo to John Sims . 
Mr. Amerasinghe said in relation to Ted Thompson ' s motives and the real reason for approaching his friend was not to discuss general administrative matters but to alert his close personal friend of the proposed supreme court reference which would embarrass Chief Justice Isaac who had been working to improve the reputation of the federal court . 
i invite all Canadians to look at the facts , to review the evidence . 
i am confident a reasonable person would reach the same shocking conclusions . 
i am confident ordinary Canadians would recognize that aspects of what the former justice minister reported in this House were incorrect and misleading and that the finding of Charles Dubin concerning the conduct of Ted Thompson is at best deficient and at worst a deliberate whitewash as he had access to all the damning information contained in the documents filed in the supreme court , and that the Canadian Judicial Council ' s examination of the conduct of Chief Justice Isaac is also inadequate and deficient . 
however , this was to be expected , given that the council did not have access to all the information contained in the secret and confidential justice department documents that were later filed with the Supreme Court of Canada . 
it appears that the Canadian Judicial Council depended solely on the word of Chief Justice Isaac who told them among other things that he never discussed Judge Jerome recusing himself from the cases , although the justice documents say exactly the opposite . 
yesterday the Supreme Court of Canada , although dismissing the stay of proceedings motion , clearly stated that both Chief Justice Isaac and Associate Chief Justice Jerome were tainted by this affair and should have nothing further to do with these cases . 
what are Canadians to think when they witness this type of conduct from our justice officials and our judges , the very people entrusted to protect our rights and freedoms and who are to uphold the rule of law to the very highest standards ? 
what are they to think when they see pertinent information being withheld from the Canadian Judicial Council , the one body entrusted to ensure that courts and judges remain independent of outside pressures so citizens can rely on the fact that they will receive fair and impartial hearings ? 
what are they to think when they hear and see this kind of conduct on the part of these officials ? 
what are Canadians to think when they hear all the damning evidence which clearly points to such inappropriate conduct ? 
and there is more . 
in a secret memo to John Sims , the Assistant Deputy Attorney General , dated December 14 , 1995 , Chris Amerasinghe states this : 
i am appalled at the irresponsible manner in which the associate chief justice , who is responsible for the proper functioning of the federal court trial division conducts the business of the court . 
it is a travesty of justice that these cases proceed at a snail ' s pace and that Jerome acquiesces in every attempt by counsel for the respondents to delay them rather than pushing counsel to deal with them speedily . 
he does not seem to care what happens . 
apparently the Chief Justice of the Federal Court either has no power to influence the conduct of the Associate Chief Justice or does not wish to do so . 
Mr. Amerasinghe attributed the associate chief justice ' s behaviour to the state of his health . 
i quote from the same memo : 
more disturbing was the fact that he did not appear to appreciate that Bayne was misleading him as to the law . 
these comments are not only in contempt of Judge Jerome and his court , they are designed to spread this contempt into the minds of anyone who read them , including the Assistant Deputy Attorney General of Canada , John Sims . 
so bitter was Amerasinghe ' s attack on Judge Jerome that John Sims blacked out those portions of Amerasinghe ' s memo before he passed it on to the members of the litigation committee . 
if Mr. Amerasinghe had justification for his attack on Judge Jerome , the proper body to take it before was the Judicial Council of Canada , instead of sowing seeds of contempt in the minds of his superiors within the Department of Justice and yet that is exactly what he did . 
it is outrageous and unacceptable that this has happened within the highest levels of the justice department . 
on May the 29 , 1996 the former justice minister stood in this House and stated : 
i want to note at the outset that as soon as the department became aware that Mr. Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac had met , and as soon as the correspondence came to light , the department provided copies of that correspondence to the lawyers acting for the three persons involved in the revocation cases pending before the Federal Court . 
the minister ' s statement was wrong and is wrong . 
counsel for the applicants received copies of the correspondence on March 7 , 1996 . 
yet we know from Mr. Amerasinghe ' s diary notes and from an e - mail dated March 1 , 1996 addressed to Mr. John Sims from Mr. Amerasinghe both these men knew of Thompson ' s letter six days before it was forwarded to counsel . 
i phoned Ted Thompson ' s office and was told by his secretary that he had written to Julius Isaac . 
i have no doubt he will advise you . 
the contents of faxed messages between Mr. Amerasinghe , Mr. John Sims and the deputy attorney general clearly reveal that these officials were aware of this issue or problem days before the letters were sent to defence counsel and is a direct contradiction to what the former justice minister stated in this House . 
the former justice minister not only submitted information that mislead the House of the facts of this case , he also withheld information for almost three months regarding this matter . 
Ted Thompson committed this breach of judicial independence on March 1 , 1996 and yet it was not brought to the floor of the House until the end of May of that same year . 
why was this matter not reported the moment the minister knew of it ? 
why did he wait until the matter became a subject of public interest in the media before he notified the House of what was happening within his department ? 
that is unacceptable and is shameful . 
it is shameful that the former minister stood in this House on more that one occasion and stated : 
from the moment that it came to the attention of the justice officials that Ted Thompson had been to see the chief justice , steps were taken to find out exactly what happened , to get copies of the correspondence and put them in the hands of the lawyers involved in the three cases . 
yet we waited for three months before he notified us of what was going on within his department . 
it is unacceptable that the former justice minister refused to remove Ted Thompson for his professional and unethical misconduct despite Reform urging him to do so . 
it was the only proper course of action to clear the air and assure Canadians that the justice department is not staffed by individuals who will violate the judicial independence of our courts . 
instead the minister turned the matter over to the former chief justice of Ontario , Charles Dubin , a person , and I quote the minister , " whose experience and integrity in such matters is beyond question '' . 
on October 1 , 1996 the minister publicly embraced Mr. Dubin ' s findings when he stated " We took the trouble to have a person of unquestioned reputation look carefully through all the facts of this matter . 
i say nonsense . 
absolute nonsense . 
if the former justice minister believed this , why did he order a new investigation into this issue when the contents of the secret documents filed with the Supreme Court of Canada were made public during the last week of the federal election ? 
those were the very documents Mr. Dubin had access to during his investigation . 
the confidential documents clearly call into question Mr. Dubin ' s findings and suggest an enormous deficiency in his conclusions and in his recommendation that left Ted Thompson within the justice department . 
in my opinion , Mr. Dubin ' s report was a whitewash . 
he completely ignored or glossed over the facts and despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , maintained that Mr. Thompson ' s conduct although inappropriate was properly motivated and within his jurisdiction . 
throughout his report he maintains the charade that Mr. Thompson ' s meeting was to discuss general administrative matters involving 12 pending revocation cases and that three current cases were mentioned inadvertently . 
this is a false story and a cover - up described within Mr. Amerasinghe ' s internal documents to his superiors . 
Ted Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac committed one of the most serious breaches of judicial interference ever experienced in this country . 
the true facts surrounding this enormous violation have been ignored and some say covered up and have just been revealed recently . 
in the words of defence counsel quoting Lord Denning , " Had this occurred in England , it would have brought down the government '' . 
we witnessed political interference in the Airbus affair and in the Krever inquiry . 
can we imagine setting up an inquiry such as the Krever inquiry and then creating legal roadblocks , as it has done , interfering with Krever ' s mandate . 
then there was the Pearson airport contract . 
a bill was rammed through the House which denied the injured people due process to file a grievance within our justice system . 
in the Somalia inquiry not only was there interference , it stopped the inquiry completely . 
there was not only political interference , the judicial process was stopped completely and Canadians were denied the full facts and truth about the horrible wrongdoing and cover - up within the Canadian military . 
is it any wonder that over 50 % of Canadians have lost faith in our courts and in our justice system after witnessing the arrogant attitude that tampering with justice and the rule of law is acceptable . 
and if you get caught , nothing happens . 
in the case of Mr. Thompson , he was transferred to somewhere else in the department . 
the Prime Minister moved the former justice minister out of justice and into health and this House cannot hold him accountable for the scandal which he has left in the justice department . 
in summation of this scandalous affair , it is clear that this all occurred because these people did not want to suffer the embarrassment of a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada . 
they chose instead to violate the independence and the impartiality of the courts and betray the faith and trust of Canadians . 
these people have to go . 
they do not belong in our justice system . 
they have proven by their actions that they are unworthy of belonging in our justice system . 
in view of this terrible government interference which runs like a current through our justice system on a regular basis , I have forwarded a complaint to the Law Society of Upper Canada asking for an immediate investigation into the conduct of Ted Thompson , John Sims and Chris Amerasinghe . 
in the light of yesterday ' s Supreme Court remarks regarding Isaac and Jerome , I have also written to the Canadian Judicial Council requesting a more thorough review of Chief Justice Isaac ' s actions as well as an examination of the conduct of Associate Chief Justice Jerome as referenced in the justice department documents filed in the Supreme Court of Canada . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to rise for the first time officially in this House . 
i want to congratulate you and all those who will be occupying the Chair during the course of this Parliament . 
i also want to take the opportunity to thank the people of Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough who have entrusted in me this great honour to represent them in these hallowed halls and in this House . 
i want to very briefly comment on the very fiery speech given by the hon. member for Crowfoot . 
i am encouraged by the member ' s vigorous pursuit of this issue . 
he has obviously done a great deal of research and a great deal of leg work to have uncovered these inadequacies and injustices that have occurred on this particular point . 
i know that the hon. member has a great deal of practical experience within the justice system . 
i just want to comment that I as well look forward to keeping this government in check in particular in the area of justice and these atrocities , some of which the hon. member has mentioned , areas such as the Krever report and the Airbus scandal . 
i too look forward to working with him in seeing that this government is held accountable . 
Mr. Jack Ramsay : 
madam Speaker , I appreciate the kind words from my hon. colleague . 
i would like to take the opportunity to publicly thank him for that and to acknowledge the fact that I was well acquainted with his father who was in this House for many years and who showed the same kind of integrity that his words have reflected . 
i appreciate very much his comments and look forward to working with him and reflecting the standard of integrity within this House and within our institutions of government that the people of Canada are demanding and have not been finding , particularly in the justice system , as clearly revealed by the Angus Reid poll of this past summer . 
again , I thank the hon. member for his kind remarks . 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I refer to my colleague ' s reference when he talked about public confidence in the court system . 
i recall that last year the member travelled the country and listened to average Canadians , especially around their lack of confidence in the Young Offenders Act . 
i would like him to comment on what is the real mood in the community and what are the mainstream Canadian values that Canadians hold which seem to be somewhat different than what they actually get from the justice system . 
there seems to be a great gap between the mentality and the inside language and the inside operations of the justice system and where they are at and where the public is act . 
there is great dissatisfaction and the polls are showing that . 
i would like the hon. member to comment on what he found when he travelled the country , the difference between what Canadians want and what they are actually getting from the justice system . 
Mr. Jack Ramsay : 
madam Speaker , we spent quite a bit of taxpayers ' dollars on the 12 - year review of the Young Offenders Act . 
when we talked to ordinary Canadians as we travelled across this country what we found was that they see a lack of ability within the Young Offenders Act to respond adequately to youth crime . 
we heard that over and over again . 
we also heard that the communities want the authority to deal with their own children restored back to them . 
families want restored back to them the authority to raise their children in a manner that they think is in the best interests of them , their communities and this country . 
families want this right , this responsibility and this authority to look after their own children returned to them . 
at the same time we see obstacles being placed in the way by the components within the justice system that have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo in an industry that spends $ 10 billion a year on youth and adult crimes . 
there is much to do in amending our laws in this country , including the Young Offenders Act , in order to regain the confidence of Canadians and place back into their hands the authority and responsibility to raise their own children in a manner they think is in the best interests of themselves , their children , their communities and this country . 
Mr. Allan Kerpan ( Blackstrap , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , again as many before me have , I would like to offer my congratulations and best wishes to you and all those who will occupy the Chair through this 36 th Parliament . 
one of the things that the member for Crowfoot talked about in his address and also in the questions and comments is the frustration that Canadians have with our legal system . 
we have seen just this past summer things like the section 745 hearings for people like Clifford Olson who is a self - admitted child killer of 11 children . 
i wonder if the member would like to comment on how things like the section 745 hearings have an effect on the people ' s frustration with the justice system . 
Mr. Jack Ramsay : 
madam Speaker , when we pass laws that destroy the peace of mind of citizens , what are we doing ? 
it is one thing to see the interpretation of the law that affects the sense of justice of our people . 
it is another thing to see the law itself create that feeling where the peace of mind is destroyed , where they cannot be at peace knowing that the justice officials are not going to interfere with the judicial independence of a judge that they may have to appear before and that they will get a fair hearing , that the individual who commits a crime will be punished in a manner according to the circumstances surrounding the offence . 
we are hearing this all across the country . 
the polls are reflecting it . 
i cannot understand why the government will not move and support the will of the majority in areas as simple as removing section 745 from the Criminal Code , the faint hope clause that gives special rights and advantages to killers in this country , and on the other hand punishes innocent people in this country . 
again , it directs punishment to innocent , law abiding people while ignoring to a large extent the criminal users of firearms . 
when we see laws passed and maintained that are punishing the innocent and creating inconveniences for the innocent , the law abiding tax paying Canadians , while at the same time giving special rights and privileges to the offender , there is something wrong with the picture and there is something wrong with the justice system in Canada . 
the only way the people can speak is through their elected representatives in the House , through the polls , letters to the editor , through petitions to this place , letters and phone calls to ministers of cabinet . 
they are expressing that discontent and a degree of frustration that indicates they have lost their sense of justice . 
it has been destroyed by the actions and the laws passed by this House . 
Mr. George Proud ( Hillsborough , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I too would like to congratulate you and the other Speakers who will occupy the chair and rule on our debates to ensure that we conduct ourselves with the level of decorum that Canadians expect of their parliamentarians . 
i would also like to ask for the patience of the members in the House to thank the people of Hillsborough for returning me to this place as their voice in the House of Commons . 
it is a great pleasure for me to serve my constituents and I plan to serve them well . 
i wish to speak in support of the Speech from the Throne , but I also wish to speak of this Parliament . 
the throne speech was very up beat . 
it spoke of the great opportunities that await us in the new millennium . 
it also set the stage for how we as Canadians will prepare our nation to enter the new century as a strong and united country . 
i would like to make one thing perfectly clear . 
the only reason the throne speech took such a positive tone is the successes of Canadians over the last four years . 
the Liberal government with the help of all Canadians turned the country ' s financial books around . 
it has been said many times that a healthy economy leads to a healthy society . 
this government also believes that a healthy society contributes to a healthy economy . 
and it is obvious after hearing the throne speech that the government plans to deliver both to Canadians . 
while there are many ways the government can work to improve our way of life , it has targeted priority areas such as our youth , health care , innovation and national unity . 
these areas represent the greatest potential for Canada . 
as the prime minister said , our children are our most precious resource . 
the Liberal government will continue to create more opportunities for our youth , opportunities for better education , more employment opportunities , a healthier lifestyle and a secure public retirement income system . 
in short , our government will secure Canada ' s future through our youth . 
at the same time , we must maintain a public health care regime . 
there is no escaping the needs of a growing population . 
this is why the Liberal government introduced public health care 30 years ago and that is why the Liberal government will secure it for another 30 years and beyond . 
another chief priority of the government is supporting innovation in Canada ' s economy . 
similar to the theory of continuous learning for workers , Canadian firms must continually strive to improve and update their processes . 
our international competitors are not standing still , so neither can we . 
the federal government has a role to play in supporting research and development and its uses within the business world . 
recently we have seen a slight evolution of the federalist approach to the issue of Quebec ' s secession . 
i want to make it known that I support the recent initiatives of the federal government and the provincial and territorial leaders . 
it is unprecedented for the House of Commons to have five official parties . 
since 1993 Canadians have wanted a change in the federal system . 
the presence of so many regional parties is evidence of that desire . 
some change has occurred but I think the results of the June election illustrate that Canadians are not yet quite satisfied . 
just like our industries must be capable of innovation , so must our Parliament be ready to change . 
with such an extraordinary mix of political parties in the House I believe the time for change is now . 
i say to my hon. colleagues there will never be a better time than now to change this system . 
most of this change concerns increasing the role of an MP . 
a member who is not in cabinet usually has little opportunity to influence legislation and other measures of policy . 
but if a group of members band together , then perhaps influence can be achieved because the rules of the game are stacked against us . 
many of us know from previous experience that all too often there is insufficient time for each member to probe the issues with questions to the witnesses . 
as well , there is always the fear that the committees are viewed as rubber stamps for the government . 
the committees should be a second defence for Canadians to be protected from unintended implications or oversights , but committees need a sufficient amount of time to conduct an effective analysis of government policy . 
along the same lines is the issue of resources available to committees . 
currently each committee must apply for funds for each individual study . 
i do not believe this is good enough . 
in my opinion we should take some lessons from our neighbours to the south . 
committee chairs should have the resources to arrange his or her own experts on staff . 
they should be in addition to research assistants available to other committee members . 
having more resources would allow members time to conduct a more thorough study of the issues that come before them . 
but we cannot provide more resources without allowing the committees to actually use them . 
the government must change its approach and be more open to change . 
we have here a wealth of knowledge . 
the collective knowledge of all 301 members of Parliament can be a force of benefit for Canadians . 
as it stands now only the few in cabinet have any real opportunity for input . 
any legislation the government introduces is debated here , but often it seems that the real meat of the legislation is contained in the corresponding regulations . 
i realize that this approach provides more flexibility to the government because it is easier to amend regulations . 
i admit there are times when it is justified , but this approach can easily be abused . 
putting the meat of the legislation in regulations does not allow Parliament a direct opportunity to investigate government policies . 
there is a balance that can be obtained by referring all regulations to the appropriate committees . 
one final point concerns private members ' business . 
i believe there are many improvements that can be made to allow private members more opportunity to introduce and pass meaningful legislation . 
part of our role here should be to act as legislators . 
currently really the only legislators here are those in cabinet . 
unfortunately I do not have time to expand on all the issues I wanted to cover . 
suffice it to say I believe the time for change is now . 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wish to offer my congratulations on your speakership once again and to all those who will be occupying the chair . 
i would like to ask the member , very briefly , to comment on this question . 
does the member agree that one of the primary functions of government in a civilized society is to provide for the peace and safety of its citizens ? 
i was wondering if at the beginning of this Parliament he would assure us that he would agree with that statement . 
the reason I ask that is I have been here for four years now and cannot understand why law and order is not more of a priority for this government . 
i want to give the House an example . 
i am very familiar with what is happening at our local high school in Yorkton . 
my children have attended there and they tell me what is going on . 
there is a serious problem with young offenders . 
many of them will attend school the next day and boast about their exploits . 
this has a very negative effect on all the other students . 
they begin to say " what does it matter what I do , who cares ? " 
it affects their studies . 
it affects their job . 
unless people realize that the law is made to be respected , they lose the thing which holds us together as a society . 
the glue which holds us together becomes soft . 
Mr. George Proud : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his questions . 
yes , I believe it is the role of government to provide stability within a country . 
i have grown up in this country and I believe , as others do , that it is the greatest country in the world . 
i also believe , along with government , that the individual members of society have a role to play in ensuring that we have a safe country in which to live . 
one of the problems we have in society today is that too many things over the last number of years have been foisted on to government and the roles of family members and other organizations have gone by the wayside . 
i believe this government should and will continue to look after the main interests of society , that being one very important interest . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
the FAMILY 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , thousands of concerned parents from all across Canada have been sending me petitions supporting my private member ' s motion to recognize the right , responsibility and liberty of parents to direct the upbringing of their children and their right to pursue family life free from unnecessary interference from government . 
many parents feel their rights and responsibilities are threatened by the government ' s attempts to fully implement the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , a UN charter which has never been approved in this Parliament . 
parents are afraid that their rights and responsibilities to properly discipline their children are threatened by the direction the Liberal government is taking . 
they say that if the convention is fully implemented government bureaucrats and the courts will have absolute power to determine what is in the best interests of the child and parents will be powerless . 
the problem seems to be that government is paying more attention to what the bureaucrats and foreign politicians are saying in the United Nations than what parents are saying here at home .

NIAGARA GRAPE AND WINE FESTIVAL 
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( St. Catharines , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to take this opportunity to invite all members of the House to one of the top 100 festival events in North America . 
the Niagara Grape and Wine Festival celebrates the annual harvest of grapes from Niagara ' s 16,000 acres of vineyards . 
thanks to the efforts and talents of local vintners , Niagara wines are more popular than ever and are expanding into the ever growing international market . 
industry Canada ' s industrial research assistant program has helped to improve the quality of Niagara vines and Niagara wines . 
a new Cool Climate Oenology and Viticulture Institute is being sponsored by a government and industry partnership and will be officially opened at Brock University next month . 
the federal government has also worked with the Niagara young people under the youth internship program , providing skills and experience for youth in jobs in the wine industry . 
i congratulate President Paul Speck and General Manager Gerry Ginsberg on the festival ' s endeavours .

speech FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua ( Vaughan - King - Aurora , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the agenda our government unveiled in the Speech from Throne is a clear cut action plan for four more years of positive change . 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast have worked hard , made tough decisions and sacrificed much , and now we are seeing the results . 
almost one million jobs have been created since 1993 , we are witnessing the longest sustained increase in youth employment since 1990 , consumer and business confidence are up , a balanced budget is within our grasp , interest rates are at an all time low . 
on June 2 Canadians voted for success . 
they voted for kept promises and they voted for a better tomorrow . 
these initiatives demonstrate that this government is - 
* * * 
ALGERIA 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Algeria has been a site of bloody conflict for years now , and the situation has been deteriorating rapidly in recent months . 
civilians , most of them women and children , continue to meet ghastly deaths . 
having lived in that country , I cannot understand how the international community can remain unmoved by the unbearable situation the people of Algeria are in . 
the truce announced by the Islamic Salvation Front for October 1 ought not to lull us into complacency . 
for the desperate Algerians , and for our fellow Canadians who fear for their brothers and sisters , it is vital that action be taken . 
many Algerian immigrants living in my riding of Louis - H é bert are concerned about the relatives and friends they have left behind . 
it is high time that each of us makes at least a minimum show of solidarity . 
i am therefore calling upon this government to speed up the family reunification procedures for Algerian nationals , which are dragging out forever despite the urgency of the situation . 
* * * 
MINNIJEAN BROWN TRICKEY 
Mrs. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take this opportunity to comment on the 40 th anniversary of an important event in black American history and to congratulate a Canadian citizen who is part of that history . 
forty years ago nine youngsters demonstrated tremendous courage in dealing with segregationist policies which excluded them from attending mainstream schools in Arkansas . 
i applaud those individuals , in particular a present Ottawa resident , Minnijean Brown Trickey , who was one of the Little Rock Nine . 
Ms. Trickey ' s act of courage opened the doors to many African American children to be admitted to the Little Rock High School and brought the issue of segregated schools to the forefront of American politics . 
bravo Minnijean Brown Trickey , a proud Canadian . 
* * * 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Kitchener - Waterloo , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to congratulate one of Kitchener - Waterloo ' s many technology based companies . 
GFI Control Systems is a Canadian company that is positioned to become the global leader in the development of production of clean alternative fuel engine control systems for gaseous fuel powered vehicles . 
worldwide demand over the next five years is forecast to be 2.7 million alternative fuel vehicles . 
GFI employs 102 full time people and uses 64 local suppliers . 
at the end of August GFI ' s investment in research and development with the help of a $ 4.3 million loan from Technology Partnerships Canada paid off . 
GFI was awarded by the Ford Motor Company the single largest alternative fuel vehicle contract ever by a big three auto maker . 
this contract is valued at more than $ 100 million and has resulted in the creation of 125 new jobs . 
congratulations to GFI and congratulations to Technology Partnerships Canada .

police OFFICERS OF CANADA 
Mr. Allan Kerpan ( Blackstrap , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this weekend more than 4,000 police officers and their families will travel to Ottawa to pay tribute to their colleagues who have fallen in the line of duty . 
every day in this country police officers sacrifice their own personal safety in order that the rest of us remain protected from the criminal acts of a few . 
unfortunately , every year some of these courageous men and women pay the ultimate price for their bravery . 
even more remain permanently injured as a result of their work . 
i would like to take this opportunity to thank on behalf of all Canadians the valiant , self - sacrificing efforts of the members of our nation ' s police forces . 
our safety is very much a result of their bravery . 
* * * 
landmines 
Mr. David Pratt ( Nepean - Carleton , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the recent announcement in Oslo , Norway that nearly 90 countries had agreed on a treaty that would ban anti - personnel landmines is a tremendous achievement for Canadian diplomacy . 
i am pleased and proud that two companies in my riding of Nepean - Carleton , Computing Devices of Canada and Thomson CSF , are actively engaged in leading edge technology for landmine detection and clearance , technology which will save lives . 
with the help of funding from the government , these two companies are working to ensure that Canada remains in the forefront of a solution to this serious international problem . 
* * * 
QUEBEC ECONOMY 
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister says there is nothing more illusive than a million dollars , when he wants to scare Quebecers who , in his opinion , are a little too keen to be masters in their own house . 
yesterday , however , Intrawest announced it was investing an additional $ 500 million in its tourist mega project at Mont Tremblant . 
Intrawest president Joe Houssian said he was not worried about the political climate . 
he went on to say that Tremblant would have a long history that would go well beyond the political history of the region . 
the Bloc Quebecois is delighted and congratulates Intrawest management on its wise decision .

arthritis MONTH 
Mr. Robert Bertrand ( Pontiac - Gatineau - Labelle , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to inform the House and all Canadians that September is arthritis month . 
arthritis is a debilitating disease that threatens the independence and quality of life of thousands of Canadian men and women . 
it is one of the most widespread chronic diseases in Canada , and cases of long term disability are most frequently due to arthritis . 
there is no cure for arthritis , and the direct and indirect costs of this disease are enormous . 
public awareness campaigns and a healthy life style can sometimes help relieve certain damaging effects of arthritis . 
health Canada is committed to continuing its involvement with other stakeholders in public and private organizations , to deal with matters concerning arthritis and how to treat its sufferers . 
the month of September is an opportunity for us to recognize the work done by the Arthritis Society and its 10,000 dedicated volunteers . 
* * * 
hockey 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , September 28 is the 25 th anniversary of an event that three out of four Canadians remember , an event where we collectively went nuts . 
by contrast the heritage minister should get a game misconduct for high spending . 
it is called Canadian culture the Liberal way . 
the sugar plums that dance in her head are coated with taxpayers ' dollars . 
she believes it is up to her and the Liberals to determine Canadian identity . 
she does not understand . 
she cannot manufacture culture . 
she cannot buy patriotism . 
Paul Henderson ' s goal was an unscripted athletic event that helped define what it is to be Canadian . 
thank you , Paul . 
your famous goal is part of what it truly means to be Canadian .

homes FIRST SOCIETY 
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan ( Winnipeg North - St. 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday this House paid tribute to one its greats , Stanley Knowles . 
how fitting it is that today I draw attention to one humanitarian work this weekend . 
tomorrow , the Homes First Society in Toronto will hold its first annual " off the street garage sale " at Nathan Phillips Square to raise funds for Savard ' s and Haven , two housing projects for homeless women in Toronto and in the Philippines . 
such projects are living examples of Stanley Knowles ' lifelong dedication to social justice for all peoples . 
i commend the organizers and supporters of tomorrow ' s fundraising event . 
i take personal pride that Filipino Canadians are in the forefront of this volunteerism . 
indeed , the Homes First Society has displayed that uncommon sense of public duty which Stanley Knowles so well embodied . 
these volunteers have dedicated themselves to the duty of citizenship that helps advance humanity forward . 
* * * 
health CARE 
Ms. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am both honoured and proud at having been chosen by the people of Bras d ' Or to be their voice in Ottawa . 
the people of Cape Breton sent a strong message to this government on June 2 . 
it is their right and the right of all Canadians to be guaranteed by this government that they will receive access to quality health care under the Canada Health Act . 
it is unacceptable for the people of Bras d ' Or to be forced to stand in line and take a number to access even minimal health care . 
these people are trying to get medical attention , not pick up a parcel at their local department store . 
it is with this in mind that I intend to make the government accountable for the devastating effect that has resulted from the cuts to health care through the CHST . 
the people in Bras d ' Or would like to send a clear message to the government that this type of treatment will not be tolerated . 
i call on the government to reverse the cuts and reinvest in health care until such time as the system addresses all the health care needs of my constituents and all Canadians . 
* * * 
JOHN COCHRANE 
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood - Assiniboine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of my constituent and friend , John Cochrane . 
John recently travelled , as a Canadian volunteer adviser , to Russia to assist a private company that publishes a newspaper and produces stencilled colour printing . 
the company which requested Mr. Cochrane ' s assistance was seeking advice on creating a new product line and improving efficiency and profit . 
Mr. Cochrane developed a plan to increase subscriptions and attract additional advertisers as well as a new and more aggressive marketing strategy . 
Mr. Cochrane , like many other CESO advisers who work as Canadian volunteer advisers to business and assist business and organizations in Canada ' s aboriginal communities , developing nations and emerging market economies in central and eastern Europe . 
CESO volunteers are skilled Canadian men and women who willingly share their lifetime of practical experience with those who need it . 
again I congratulate all CESO volunteers and especially my constituent , John Cochrane , on a job well done .

canada SUMMER GAMES 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with a great deal of pride that I rise to inform the members of the House that on August 9 to 23 in my constituency of Brandon - Souris we hosted the 1997 Canada Summer Games . 
i would like to thank the Prime Minister and the minister of sport , as well as my leader , Mr. Jean Charest , for being a part of that - 
the Speaker : 
i do hate to intervene but I remind the hon. member no names . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik : 
i do apologize , Mr. Speaker . 
it was a rookie mistake . 
i would like to thank the leader of my party for being there . 
i would also like to congratulate the 4,000 young men and women who came from all 10 provinces and 2 territories and demonstrated both the spirit of sport and the spirit of unity . 
i thank also the 6,000 volunteers that took part in my community and the surrounding area to put on the best ever Canada games . 
our most valuable resource in this country is our youth and if anybody is going to pull it together it is going to be them '' . 
the Speaker : 
i would like to make a very brief comment or observation . 
it would seem that yesterday we accomplished what we set out to do . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
government EXPENDITURES 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this summer when the Liberals were out making election promises they swore that any budget surplus would be split 50:50 , half would go to new Liberal spending programs naturally , and the other half would actually go back into taxpayers ' pockets or to debt retirement . 
but now that the Liberals are back in power they have changed their tune . 
they used to sing The Taxman by the Beatles , now they have changed to another one entitled Hey , Big Spender . 
when the government spends $ 42,000 on a musical study entitled " The Social Origins of the Medieval Latin Lyrical Song , " why should ordinary Canadians believe that the government will ever be able to give Canadians the tax relief they deserve ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Canada Council gives grants to people to do some very useful work . 
to be knowledgeable about great ancient music is very important for some people . 
i am not an expert but I love Gregorian music . 
it was part of the services in the Catholic Church when I was a kid . 
it is medieval and very good and very peaceful to listen to after a good question period . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure if the Prime Minister was part of a medieval Latin song , but he has been around for a while . 
i heard the Prime Minister whistling another ditty yesterday . 
i think it was called " Smoking in the Boys Room '' . 
apparently the government has decided to spend $ 1.5 million to subsidize smokes for convicts in the Kingston penitentiary . 
we suspect he has been blowing smoke about this whole budgetary surplus thing . 
i think that is a given . 
but does he really think that spending $ 1.5 million to subsidize smokes for convicts is the best way to spend the money that he has siphoned out of Canadian small businesses ? 
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for posing the first question of my new position . 
i want to take advantage of the occasion to commend the good work that is done by Correctional Service Canada whose 300 executives sat in this House last night . 
they do good work . 
they deserve to be complimented and I am proud to do it . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure what they have been smoking , but it was something . 
we also know that the Prime Minister enjoys a good golf game . 
heaven knows he has teed off plenty of voters . 
but does he really have to waste taxpayers ' dollars on it ? 
my question is obvious . 
are these kind of spending programs really more important to the Liberals than offering some prospect of tax relief for the ordinary Canadian citizen ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yes there is a beautiful golf course in the national park at Cape Breton which is enjoyed by the thousands of visitors who come there in the summer . 
it is an area of Canada that needs economic development . 
the golf course was developed a long time ago and it has been made adequate for golfers . 
the people who play there pay and that helps . 
on top of that , it helps the tourist industry in an area which needs some help . 
it is about modernizing a golf course a bit for tourists to visit , in one of the most beautiful parts of Canada which has some big economic problems . 
i think the Reform Party should compliment the government for doing something for a region that needs it .

health PROTECTION BRANCH 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Dr. Michelle Brill Edwards uncovered dangerous safety violations at Canada ' s health watchdog , the health protection branch . 
i have proof here that senior department bureaucrats have unethically opened her personal , confidential files in an attempt to smear her just hours after her public disclosure . 
does the health minister condone these attempts to smear her reputation ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am aware of the news reports this morning about a file being asked for by an official at Health Canada . 
it is for that very reason that this week I took three important steps to ensure its continuing strength : first , a moratorium on future cuts ; second , the appointment of an arm ' s length science advisory board ; third - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Macleod . 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is interesting that this minister himself is responsible for the cuts that he is now undoing . 
Dr. Brill - Edwards is an expert . 
she says the health protection branch is unsafe . 
now health bureaucrats are trying to ruin her reputation and smother the truth . 
why is the health minister afraid of this scientist ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one thing I have tried to make a habit is to get the facts before I jump to conclusions . 
i caution the hon. member to get the facts before he characterizes conduct in that irresponsible way . 
the third step I took was to prepare a consultation document to involve all Canadians , not just one or two in this discussion of the future of the health protection branch . 
i do not have to be told by former employees or by anybody else what the role of the health protection branch is . 
i am firmly committed to making sure it does its job in the most effective way .

speech FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister . 
in his speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne , the Prime Minister urged Quebecers to put their trust in the Calgary declaration , the ramifications of which became even murkier yesterday with the replies the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs gave to our questions . 
my question is a very simple one : 
given its constitutional history , what makes the Prime Minister think that Quebecers can trust the Liberal government ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Quebecers are visibly losing faith in the Bloc Quebecois . 
this is clear from the recent election . 
and the more they could be convinced that they do not have to choose between Quebec and Canada , that these two formidable entities can join forces and make them stronger and will be more indispensable to them than ever in the next millennium , the more they will turn away from the Bloc Quebecois in mistrust . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , for the minister ' s information , the Bloc Quebecois still holds the majority of seats in Quebec . 
that having been said , when we hear that being as unique as Pacific salmon is the same thing as distinct society , we might well wonder . 
how can the Prime Minister hope for Quebecers ' trust , when his government ' s only strategy since the last referendum has been to threaten Quebec with its clever Plan B ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , far from making any threats , the government is calling for calm and democratic debate of very serious matters : 
how does secession square with democracy ? 
there is no model for it anywhere . 
let me illustrate . 
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and the Premier of Quebec gave the example of the recent referendum in Wales , noting that 50 % plus one was enough . 
i must give you the following information , which is important to the debate . 
the Tories asked the British Prime Minister not to apply the results to a simple decentralization because - 
the Speaker : 
pardon me for interrupting the minister , but the member for Lac - Saint - Jean has the floor .

speech FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the future federal minister of education , whoever he may be . 
in his response to the Speech from the Throne , the Prime Minister kept for himself the announcement of new meddling in areas of provincial jurisdiction . 
the Prime Minister announced the government ' s intention to set up a fund to distribute bursaries directly to students . 
how can the minister play saviour and announce such a fund worth $ 1 billion without blushing , when his cuts to education , which will amount to $ 10 billion , have put students in debt like never before ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will use my example of Wales another time . 
the announcement for students is excellent news . 
you know , the Natural Sciences Engineering and Research Council , the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the Medical Research Council of Canada offered , for the last year available , bursaries worth $ 175 million to 13,359 students . 
many of us benefited from them , including perhaps the hon. member . 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are witnessing the federal government try to dole out federal money in order to buy students . 
i would ask the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs if he intends to give the money for this new program to the Quebec government , as has been done with the loans and bursaries program for the past 30 years ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :

multilateral AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the prime minister . 
the Canadian government has been busily negotiating a multilateral agreement on investment with profound implications for Canadians . 
my office has been deluged with calls from people who want to know what this will mean . 
they want to have their say , not after the ink is dry on the agreement but before the government enters into any such deal . 
will the prime minister make a firm commitment today to hold full public hearings across the country prior to any such investment deal being signed ? 
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. leader of the NDP for the question . 
this is my first opportunity to reply . 
canada has learned the lesson over the last 10 years that doing business without agreements and without a level playing field can be a very turbulent thing indeed . 
hence , the attempt is being made to create the MAI . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I directed my question to the prime minister and I am hoping we are going to get an answer . 
the head of the World Trade Organization has said of the MAI process : " We are writing the constitution for a new global economy '' . 
surely an agreement of this importance deserves the same standard of public disclosure , input and consultation that Canadians have demanded with respect to their own Constitution . 
it is clear that the government intended to sign , seal and deliver the MAI before the last election , even without consultation . 
will the prime minister assure us today that Canadians will have their say ? 
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , having spent 10 years in opposition in the province of Ontario I understand full well the temptation to speculate on what will be contained in something . 
i should point out to the House that at this stage the negotiators are still negotiating what they are going to negotiate .

infrastructure 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a very Liberal question for the Minister of Transport . 
why were two contracts worth over a $ 100 million given to two companies , both untendered ? 
even worse , both companies have at the top of the list of officers the past president of the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia . 
hon. David M Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like first to congratulate the hon. member ' s appointment as critic for the Conservative Party and I welcome him back to the House . 
he did raise this with me privately and it is a matter which I undertook to discuss with my officials . 
this is a federal - provincial funding agreement . 
highways are the responsibility of the provinces . 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary is for the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada . 
the Highway 104 agreement includes clauses that clearly contravene the Competition Act , which ensures choices and the right to transportation and prohibits limiting facilities for transportation . 
i requested the Federal Bureau of Competition to investigate the agreement which eliminates competition and choices and limits competition . 
will the minister assure the House that there will be no political interference in any resulting investigation , even though the federal government is a partner to the tune of $ 27 million in this agreement ? 
hon. David M Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do think it is somewhat premature to speculate about using quasi - judicial review bodies or agencies when we have not established the facts . 
i have undertaken to get the facts for the hon. member . 
until that time I think we should examine them and see if the problem is as acute as he says it is . 
* * * 
taxation 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , they are at it again over here . 
i suppose Canadian merchants will be happy to know that this prime minister ' s government is keeping up its outrageous spending habits . 
can the prime minister tell this House if he really thinks that government spending , investments as they are called , like spending $ 72,000 on something called a mystery shopping program is more important to Canadians than tax relief ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this government has made it very clear from the beginning that it is our intention to bring in tax relief . 
if the hon. member will take a look at what we did in previous budgets he will see very clearly that we have begun the process of tax relief , is a welcome change I must say after 10 years of tax increases from the Tories . 
we have very clearly reversed the trend of constant tax increases by the Tories . 
we are very committed to tax decreases , which will be evident in subsequent budgets as well . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , how do they spell relief over there ? 
the prime minister could be whistling " Pennies from Heaven '' . 
i would like to remind this government that it did not win a lottery . 
any surplus belongs to the Canadian people , not to the Liberal Party . 
was it necessary for this government to spend $ 50 million to build ski chalets in Mont Tremblant or $ 70,000 to build an ice cream parlour ? 
my question for the prime minister is why will he not give surplus money back to the people instead of blowing it on things like fancy ski resorts or ice cream parlours ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Saint - Maurice , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is almost a joy to have the hon. member asking me what we will do with the surplus in future years . 
no prime minister in the last 30 years has had to deal with the problem of a surplus . 
when we started the government was spending $ 120 billion on programs a year . 
that has been reduced to $ 104 billion or less . 
with respect to the problem of deciding what to do with the surplus , we did manage our spending very tightly and I am happy that the people of Canada supported the program of reduction in expenditures .

MIRABEL AIRPORT 
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
on April 14 , the then Minister of Transport stated he was quite happy to co - operate with any organization that wished to improve the utilization of Mirabel airport . 
what is the Minister of Transport waiting for to appoint a federal representative to the Tardif commission on the future of Mirabel ? 
hon. David M Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member knows full well that the national airports policy is designed to turn the day - to - day operation of some airports over to local authorities . 
the A é roports de Montr é al group made a decision to transfer flights from Mirabel to Dorval . 
i received a letter from the Quebec transport minister inviting me to sit on a commission . 
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my next question is for the Prime Minister . 
when will the Prime Minister respond to the Quebec premier ' s request for an urgent meeting to follow up on this issue and ensure Mirabel ' s development ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Transport just answered the question . 
it is not a transportation issue at this point in time . 
if I am not mistaken , the premier of Quebec was a Conservative minister at the time . 
this is a long - established system . 
they are the ones making decisions . 
that is why we are willing to consider transportation issues . 
if they say a bad decision was made at the time , we cannot overturn it now because the policy is to turn airports over to local -

BRITISH COLUMBIA 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when a senator from British Columbia commented on renegotiating British Columbia ' s role in Confederation the intergovernmental affairs minister responded with comments that cannot even be repeated in this House . 
while this minister has worked extremely hard at accommodating Quebec ' s desire to renegotiate its role in Confederation , he responds to the concerns of British Columbians with the verbal equivalent of the Trudeau salute . 
what will the minister do to assure British Columbians that he will be as sympathetic to their concerns as he is to Quebecers ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think it would be very helpful if the hon. member were able to quote what I said . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is unparliamentary language for me to quote what he was reported to say on TV last night . 
when foreign overfishing threatened Atlantic fishing stocks in 1995 this government responded by seizing a foreign trawler . 
this year when foreign fishing threatened Pacific salmon stocks this government responded by taking the British Columbia government to court . 
why is this government taking such a hard line approach toward British Columbia ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
each province has its problems and concerns and governments are not always as good as they should be . 
but what does this have to do with secession ?

canada POST CORPORATION 
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold - Girard ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Labour . 
collective bargaining talks between the Canada Post Corporation and the postal workers ' union are breaking down , as was unfortunately hoped by the minister responsible for Canada Post . 
does the minister recognize that he must take action to restore at least some trust , a necessary ingredient in successful collective bargaining ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
he worked with union and management in order to try to bring about a settlement . 
he was not able to bring about a settlement . 
he has reported to me and I will be making a statement on or before October 7 . 
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold - Girard ( Jonqui è re , BQ : 
Mr. Speaker , in view of what the minister just said , will he pledge to take other measures to improve negotiations and make them successful ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Canada Labour Code has worked well for both management and labour in this country over the years . 
i have to evaluate the information that I have and make a decision as to what is best for Canada Post and for CUPW . 
when I do that I will issue a statement on or before October 7 , as I indicated .

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , or shall I say the compulsory wheat board . 
rather than his monopolistic all or nothing exclusion and inclusion clauses , why does Bill C - 4 introduced by the government in this House yesterday not provide western Canadian grain farmers with real freedom of choice in how they market their very own wheat and barley ? 
Mr. Gerry Byrne ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is my first opportunity as the parliamentary secretary to the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board to address the very very important question raised by the hon. member . 
it speaks exactly to the heart of the bill . 
what the minister and this legislation have proposed for the first time in a very long time has come from farmers themselves , from producers . 
farmers and producers themselves will have a direct role in the management of that agency and they will control their destiny . 
that is the democratic process and I think it is a very good piece of legislation . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am glad the parliamentary secretary had the opportunity to speak . 
i only wish he would answer the question . 
looking at the bill it is certainly highly questionable whether the board of directors will ever be able to make the Canadian Wheat Board voluntary . 
in addition to CSIS , another government agency not held accountable under access to information is the Canadian Wheat Board . 
can the hon. parliamentary secretary explain how the new board of directors themselves will be held accountable to the farmers who elect them when they will not be able to tell them anything about the top secret Canadian Wheat Board operations ? 
Mr. Gerry Byrne ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what we are discussing here is a principle of democracy . 
the hon. member should understand that under the current legislation which is before the House of Commons today , clearly two - thirds or 10 out of 15 members of the board of directors will come from producers . 
if the hon. member does not understand a thing about democracy , perhaps he should be talking directly to some of the farmers . 
i will quote a farmer , Mr. John Rowett , " It is more grassroots . 
you know , the producers are the guys who really know what is good for producers , right ? " 
perhaps what the hon. member -

telecommunications 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry . 
the government has forced the CRTC to issue satellite broadcasting licences to all companies applying for them , regardless of their solvency . 
now AlphaStar has gone bankrupt , leaving 6,000 customers stranded without service and stuck with totally useless equipment . 
given his responsibilities in this matter , does the minister intend to take action to compensate them and to finally regulate this sector ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate the new member on her question . 
i will respond by saying that we did not tell the CRTC it must issue licences to any and all companies wishing one . 
we simply indicated that it was unsatisfactory to a government wishing for competition in a very important sector to have the CRTC decide how many companies could compete in it . 
however , All applicanats are required to submit a viable business plan to the CRTC .

housing 
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation . 
the statements by the Ontario government about the proposed changes to the administration of co - operative and other social housing is causing extreme concern for those residents . 
what assurance can the minister give these residents that the future of co - operative and other social housing will remain secure ? 
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on September 2 the Ontario advisory committee on housing reform reported to the minister of housing in Ontario . 
we are waiting for the position of the Ontario government . 
until we know the position of the Ontario government there will be no further negotiations .

CANADIAN PENSION PLAN 
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , taxpayers would wind up paying 9.9 percent of their salary as a result of the Canada pension plan as proposed by the Liberals . 
if the minister of heritage had lost her election and lived until 75 , she would have collected $ 2.8 million . 
how will she continue to justify gouging taxpayers ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party obviously does not like the Canada pension plan . 
its members made it very clear that they would see it destroyed . 
what they have presented so far , their super RRSP would bring in a rate of 13 percent , roughly 4 percent and 5 percent higher than the premiums that we have agreed to with the provinces , including I might point out the province of Alberta . 
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , somehow I knew they would justify gouging taxpayers . 
they put themselves on a pedestal above taxpayers who pay the CPP , just like the leader of the fifth party who is looking forward to a pension of more than $ 4.2 million , just like the Minister of Justice who is looking forward to more than $ 1.5 million . 
Brian Tobin , the former Liberal fisheries minister and the premier of Newfoundland is currently receiving $ 3.8 million . 
will they at least allow those members of Parliament who want to opt out of the super rich gold plated pension plan the opportunity to do so ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member should get his facts straight . 
first of all those numbers that the member has just quoted are garbage . 
second of all why does he not deal with the real numbers ? 
why is he afraid to stand up here and explain to the Canadian people that if 9.9 is a gouge , then what is 13 percent which his party has talked about ? 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is also to the Minister of Finance . 
yesterday the minister moved in the direction of privatizing the administration of the Canada pension plan through the creation of a fund of $ 100 billion to be managed by his friends on Bay Street , those boys in red suspenders . 
in light of that , I want to ask the minister today whether he can at least ensure us that he will not change the rules where at least 80 percent of the pension money must be invested here in Canada . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is in the bill exactly as the hon. member has said . 
perhaps before asking the question he might want to read it . 
what we have said very clearly is that there may be at some future time the intention to change that rule , but it is not the government ' s intention to do so now . 
what is important to understand is the position of the NDP . 
is the hon. member saying that he is against an independent investment board ? 
is the hon. member saying that he is against the Canada pension plan achieving a higher rate of return than has been - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Qu ' Appelle . 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what the member is for is for the minister to answer a question for once in the House . 
in light of the decision reached yesterday with respect to the bill to freeze the annual CPP exemption at $ 3,500 a year , and the fact that it will hit low income earners , women and the disabled of this country very hard , can he explain why he wants to shift the burden onto low income people ? 
why is he playing Robin Hood in reverse in this country ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there are two ways to destroy the Canada pension plan . 
one is the way the Reform Party has brought forth , which is to do so openly . 
the second way is the NDP ' s way , which is to say " Do not change it , do not deal with the problems and let it crumble under its own weight '' . 
if the NDP wants to destroy the Canada pension plan , why is it not being honest about it ?

free TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , perhaps I may first thank my constituents for giving me this chance to come back to the Parliament of Canada to work on their behalf . 
my question is directed to the Prime Minister . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , during the 1993 election campaign , we said we wanted to improve the free trade agreement , and we improved it in areas including the environment , labour and other sectors as well . 
that was part of our program . 
we were not against free trade as such , but we felt that the agreement as negotiated needed improvement . 
we were successful in that respect . 
i am pleased the system is working well . 
i am also delighted to see the hon. member back in the House , and I wish him the best of luck . 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , would the Prime Minister confirm that the changes made in the free trade agreement were very marginal ones ? 
is he prepared to tell this House and all Canadians that the free trade agreement was a very progressive measure and a very important one for all Canadians and explain why he came out so vehemently against the free trade agreement in a number of advertising campaigns that were extremely damaging for the future of our country ' s trade ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , regarding the debate during the 1988 election campaign , that was the only campaign since 1963 in which I did not run . 
when I became Leader of the Liberal Party , we reviewed the policy and we adjusted it . 
we found that improvements were necessary . 
in the days following my election in November 1993 , we had talks with the American and Mexican governments . 
we obtained improvements , and subsequently the government signed an agreement that works very well , thanks to the improvements we made to the agreement in general , and that was my party ' s policy during the election campaign in 1993 .

environment 
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the citizens of Windsor and Essex county raised concerns about not getting timely and accurate warnings of severe weather conditions . 
following the meeting my Windsor colleagues and I had with the Minister of the Environment , can the minister tell us what action she will be taking concerning severe weather operations in southwestern Ontario and in particular Windsor and Essex county ? 
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague and those other colleagues in the Windsor , Essex and Sarnia areas for the work they have done with the communities in their areas . 
it is of concern to my department that citizens in those areas that are prone to severe weather events have timely and accurate weather forecasting information . 
my department , besides having improved phone access and having worked with the media , will be launching a public participation process to help the communities get the kind of information they require . 
we are also having an independent consultant work with that public participation group to this end .

health 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the response today in the House by the Minister of Health regarding the serious issue of this government accessing the personal and confidential files of Dr. Mich è le Brill - Edwards is unbelievably irresponsible and speaks to his own decision this summer to cut the drug and food labs in the health protection branch . 
i want to ask the Minister of Health , if he cannot even protect the confidentiality of an individual ' s files , how can we be assured he is protecting the health and safety of Canadians ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the hon. member to the House . 
i want to work constructively with her in what I know is a shared objective of ensuring the health of Canadians but she is making it very difficult from the beginning . 
i told the House earlier that I have asked officials to look into the news reports this morning . 
when the facts are known we will be in a position to discuss it . 
as far as the health protection branch is concerned , this is the minister who put a freeze on those cuts , this is the minister who is going to appoint a science advisory board to give us independent advice on what scientists we need . 
and this is the minister who is going to involve the public and the health protection branch in an open and full discussion of its future . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is the minister who this summer eliminated the drug research lab and gutted the food research lab . 
how does the Minister of Health intend to fulfil his legal duties under the food protection act if he has already eliminated the scientists who carry out those duties on his behalf ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have already made it clear that we are going to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the health protection branch , which is an important service of government , is there to safeguard the health and safety of Canadians . 
i encourage the hon. member to take part in the public consultation process we are going to go through over the coming months . 
i encourage the hon. member to contribute constructively to the process . 
i hope her involvement will go beyond wagging her finger in this House .

pensions 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Canada pension plan disability program has an appeal process . 
currently there are over 4,000 people in Canada waiting for their appeal to be heard . 
once pension benefits are granted by the review tribunal , the government officials have instructed to appeal every single case to the pension appeal board . 
there are just 20 federal appeal board judges to handle this huge backlog and a waiting period of up to four years for Canadians who need this pension . 
will the Prime Minister or the government tell us what their plan is to address this injustice to thousands of disabled Canadians who are waiting for an answer on this very critical issue ? 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew ( Secretary of State ( Children and Youth ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is a major concern . 
anything that involves individuals with disabilities particularly when it comes to the benefits that are due to them is of major concern to the government . 
we are working very hard on this . 
we will get back to the member with detailed information . 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , will the minister begin showing compassion by telling the House today what specific measures and time lines the government plans to implement to streamline the appeals process . 
how soon will the wait be over for the thousands of Canadians who need an answer now ? 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew ( Secretary of State ( Children and Youth ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a difficult process and it is something which deserves more time and attention . 
i do not have the information for the member right now , but we will get back to him very soon .

points OF ORDER 
comments DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
the Speaker : 
i have received a notice of a point of order from the member for Winnipeg North Centre . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
today during question period questions were raised concerning the access of the personal and confidential files of Dr. Michelle Brill Edwards . 
for the benefit of the Minister of Health I would like to table the document indicating her files were accessed by Mr. Joe Losos , Assistant Deputy Minister of the Department of Health . 
the Speaker : 
my dear colleague , two things . 
first , I know that you have a piece of paper which I would ask you not to use as a prop . 
second , individual members cannot table documents such as these . 
i guess it could be tabled if the hon. member had unanimous consent . 
i am addressing myself directly now to the member for Winnipeg North Centre . 
were you seeking unanimous consent ? 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis : 
Yes. 
the Speaker : 
the answer is yes . 
now , is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
No. 
the Speaker : 
there is not unanimous consent .

the LATE ALISTAIR FRASER 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , those of us who have been around for a number of years , although not actually in the House of Commons , were shocked and saddened earlier this month to hear the news of the passing of an officer emeritus of this House , the former Clerk of the House , Mr. Alistair Fraser . 
Mr. Fraser was born into a family that values public service . 
both of his grandfathers were distinguished statesmen serving in Parliament and at the provincial and territorial levels . 
both his father and one of his grandfathers were lieutenant - governors of Nova Scotia and even today , if someone asks an old - timer in Guysborough the way to the Fraser summer place , one will be directed very clearly to what is referred to as the governor ' s house . 
immediately upon graduating from McGill University , Mr. Fraser joined the Canadian army , serving until the end of World War II. 
after serving briefly on the staff of the Hon. Brooke Claxton in Ottawa , he attended the University of British Columbia law school , practising law in Prince Rupert before returning to Ottawa as executive assistant to the Hon. James Sinclair . 
subsequently he served in that same position with the Hon. Ross MacDonald and the Hon. Jack Pickersgill . 
Mr. Fraser was twice a candidate for the House of Commons : once on the west coast in Esquimalt - Saanich and once on the east coast in Pictou . 
Mr. Fraser was appointed deputy clerk in 1966 and clerk , the following year . 
he performed his duties with dignity , wisdom and an unequalled sense of humour . 
for myself , I would like to add that Alistair Fraser touched the lives not only of parliamentarians , but of the people working in the House of Commons during his time there . 
as you know , I was a young employee of the House of Commons at the time and could see firsthand the kindness , the wisdom and the intelligence of my boss , Alistair Fraser . 
following his retirement , Mr. Fraser continued his involvement in the area of parliamentary affairs through the publication of two editions of Beauchesne ' s parliamentary rules . 
in his visits to the hill , he always brought along his enthusiasm and his sense of humour . 
he will be sorely missed . 
i offer my condolences to the members of his family , to all his friends and , I would add , to the employees of the House and the table officers , all of whom shared this moment of sadness . 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the Reform Party of Canada to pay tribute to a beloved servant of the House of Commons . 
Alistair Graeme Fraser was born in Toronto in January of 1923 into a family distinguished for its political service . 
after graduating from the University of British Columbia in law and practising for a short time in Prince Rupert , British Columbia , he moved to Ottawa and worked for 27 years in this place , serving as executive assistant to several Liberal ministers , after which he was appointed Clerk of the House of Commons for 12 years . 
Mr. Fraser presided as Clerk over some revolutionary developments in this House : the creation of the parliamentary interns group , the reorganization of the role of pages in the House and most important , the introduction of this Chamber to all Canadians through live television broadcasts . 
he possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of the complex rules and procedures of this place , so much so that he co - authored several editions of Beauchesne ' s Parliamentary Rules and Forms , the commentary on the standing orders of the House that all members consult almost daily . 
it tries to strike a balance between the freedom of the member to speak and the member ' s responsibility to abide by the rules of decorum and procedure intended to benefit all members . 
it combines firmness with good humour and Mr. Fraser was well known for his keen sense of humour . 
Pierre Trudeau , who was leader of the opposition on October 9 , 1979 , a couple of weeks after Mr. Fraser retired as Clerk said this about him : 
they do not think of self but bend on their will and their stamina to making the House of Commons work . 
on a personal note , when I was elected to this House in 1972 , Mr. Fraser was in the House . 
as a 30 - year - old member in this Chamber it was very nice to have somebody sitting at that table who could fill me in on the rules that everybody else knew . 
it was nice to have somebody to assist me in preparing my private member ' s bills and my questions . 
i always found that Mr. Fraser and all those he taught , many of whom are here today , had that fairness and respect for all members of Parliament no matter what their politics . 
we would like to pass on to Mr. Fraser ' s family our wishes and comfort for the honourable life and tradition of service that he brought to this House . 
i would like to tell them that we all remember him very well . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I in turn would like to join my colleagues who have just spoken in paying tribute to Alistair Fraser , who , as has been pointed out in the last few minutes , was Clerk of the House of Commons from 1967 to 1979 . 
although many of us here today did not have the good fortune to meet and get to know Mr. Fraser , he served the Canadian public and this venerable institution in which we sit for many years , and his memory will not soon disappear from its hallowed walls . 
he first came to the House in 1951 as an assistant to the then fisheries minister , the Hon. James Sinclair , moving on to take up the position of Clerk Assistant , as the Government House Leader pointed out , and then Clerk . 
on September 1 of this year , he passed away , leaving us all saddened . 
a lawyer by training , Mr. Fraser came from a Liberal family of long standing in his province of birth . 
his father and his grandfather were lieutenant - governors of Nova Scotia and his grandfather was even a member of Parliament . 
it was through his efforts and those of the present Clerk of the House of Commons that the Parliamentary Internship Programme was set up , providing an opportunity for numerous Canadians and Quebecers to work in this place for the representatives of the public , to achieve a better knowledge and understanding of this universally admired democratic institution , and to pass that knowledge and understanding on to others . 
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois , I would like to express deepest condolences to his family and friends and , as I said at the beginning of my speech , to assure them that his memory will remain very much alive in this House for many years to come , because the volume to which he contributed is something we consult on a daily basis . 
he left his stamp on two editions of Beauchesne , which is something of a bible in the work of the House . 
once again , on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois , I offer heartfelt condolences to his family and friends . 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too wish to join on behalf of our party in expressing our condolences to Mr. Fraser ' s family . 
i felt particularly moved when I heard about his passing . 
Mr. Fraser swore me in as a member of Parliament on four separate occasions : in 1968 , 1972 , 1974 and 1979 . 
he was extremely well liked and highly respected by all members of the House , on all sides of the House , during the time he was clerk of this Chamber . 
he was also known as the Mr. Rules of this place , along with the former member for Winnipeg North Centre , Stanley Knowles . 
it is rather ironic that the last time my colleague from Winnipeg - Transcona encountered Mr. Fraser was at Mr. Knowles ' funeral back in June . 
the two of them were friends and colleagues . 
the two of them were experts in the rules . 
they made an immense contribution toward the evolution of this place through a fairly revolutionary time . 
the rules were changed , which radically changed the operation of the institution . 
there was the introduction of television , which again changed the way this place operates . 
he was also a great parliamentarian in terms of the real love of this place . 
he was fair . 
he was above the partisan battle of the House of Commons . 
best of all , he was a friend . 
because of that , on behalf of my party , I want to extend to his family and to his friends our very sincere condolences on his passing . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with sadness that I rise to add my voice to those paying tribute to Mr. Alistair Graeme Fraser . 
i met Mr. Fraser on several occasions when my father took his oath in this House . 
he was , like I , a Nova Scotian . 
he often referred to his field at Guysborough , which was very important to him . 
his brothers and their families shared that home . 
on September 25 , 1967 the journals of this House recorded the announcement of Mr. Fraser ' s appointment as clerk of the House of Commons . 
when he retired in 1979 this House was different than it is today . 
Mr. Fraser loved this Chamber . 
the people who worked in and around it were very important to him . 
he knew political life mattered and that those who practised it , supported it and reported it were key to the basic freedoms of this country . 
he saw Parliament Hill as a welcome place for those who sought to learn about it and who came to pay their respects . 
someone once said that Mr. Fraser saw this place as a sort of university . 
he devoted much time to explaining it to the people who came here . 
he was critical to the success of parliament and the parliamentary internship program . 
he supported the establishment of the Canadian study of the parliamentary group and he represented this institution in the Parliament of the World with distinction . 
at his retirement he was made an honorary member , officer of the House , with a seat at the table before us . 
he took this honour very seriously . 
his counsel remained available to several committees and his testimony was given to a special committee established following the famous ringing of the bells , which remained lively and cogent in his critique of the House of Commons . 
parliament has too few friends . 
Mr. Fraser ' s death robs us of an ally and one of the Commonwealth ' s great parliamentary officers . 
on behalf of the Conservative Party , I add my voice of condolence to the family , to this House and to all Canadians , for Mr. Fraser will be sorely missed . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i would like to acknowledge the very gracious tributes paid to Mr. Fraser from members of all sides of the House . 
i had the privilege of meeting Mr. Fraser in 1967 , when he was clerk and I was working in this place for the summer . 
i acknowledge that everything which has been said about him is true . 
he was a wonderful builder of Parliament and a real cornerstone of the House of Commons . 
the words which have been uttered about him by all hon. members are very fitting .

interparliamentary DELEGATIONS 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 34 , I am pleased to table , in both official languages , the report of the parliamentary delegation that travelled to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam , and to Kaohsiung and Taipei , Taiwan , from March 29 to April 8 , 1997 .

MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
hon. Sheila Copps ( for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 6 , an act to provide for an integrated system of land and water management in the Mackenzie Valley , to establish certain boards for that purpose and to make consequential amendments to other acts .

criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , constituents of my riding are deeply concerned with the plaguing problem of street prostitution . 
they want the penalties made tougher in order to make control easier . 
they remember when the law was different and we did not have the pervasive street trade . 
the way the Criminal Code reads now , public communication to obtain sexual services carries only a penalty of summary conviction . 
in most cases the offender is given a summons , like a traffic ticket , which brings a fine . 
the amendment will give the system a procedural option , something the police in my riding have been asking for . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed . )

criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to introduce this bill . 
there is a serious gap in the law for public order and community peace . 
if a mall security guard legally removes a problem person for public disturbance , that person can return only moments later provided they do not resist when originally being escorted off the premises . 
this can happen in an unending cycle . 
the amendment would simply prevent repeated and unnecessary mischief without consequence . 
it is one of the practical tools that can help the public overcome its cynicism concerning the absurdities of the justice system . 
i urge its adoption as it reflects public expectation of the law . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed . )

access TO INFORMATION ACT 
Ms. Colleen Beaumier ( Brampton West - Mississauga , Lib . ) : moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 208 , an act to amend the Access to Information Act . 
this bill would provide stiff penalties against any person who improperly destroys or falsifies government records in an attempt to deny right of access to information under the Access to Information Act . 
this bill is about the protection of our public records . 
in January of this year , federal information commissioner John Grace released his report to the Minister of Health on his lengthy investigations into the tainted blood scandal . 
in this report specific mention was made of the fact that there are no sanctions in place against public servants who may be found to have improperly destroyed records . 
in his annual report , released two days ago , the commissioner reiterated his concerns about document tampering by public servants and renewed his call for the creation of penalties for those actions . 
this bill provides us with the necessary tools to prevent future occurrences of document tampering .

criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague from Prince George - Peace River for seconding this bill . 
this is a very serious problem in this country , one that touches 160,000 Canadians every year . 
it is a $ 1.6 billion problem , and that problem is auto theft . 
our loose laws are encouraging people to break the law , especially male young offenders who steal over half the cars stolen in Canada , mostly to joy ride and experience a thrill at someone else ' s expense . 
the problem is out of control in British Columbia . 
in my own constituency , as an example , in the city of Chilliwack auto theft was up 87 percent last year alone . 
my bill would strengthen the provisions of section 335 of the Criminal Code , a section under which young offenders are usually charged . 
it prescribes a minimum and a maximum sentence in terms of a fine , a jail term or restitution to the victim . 
it also states that parents of young offenders who have contributed to the delinquency of their child can be held responsible for restitution . 
i hope that all members will take note of this serious problem in Canada and give careful consideration and support for this joy riding bill .

young OFFENDERS ACT 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague from Surrey North for seconding this motion . 
it is an honour today to rise and introduce this bill on amending the Young Offenders Act . 
this summer the new justice minister said the YOA would be a priority yet we did not see anything in the throne speech about it . 
reform believes that the YOA is a priority and thus the reason for our bill and the amendments to lower the age from 12 to 10 , to raise 16 and 17 year olds to adult court , automatically transferring serious violent young offenders into adult court aged 14 and 15 and removing the privacy provision for young offenders convicted of violent offences , particularly repeat violent offenders . 
the Reform bill does much more . 
i hope we get the opportunity in the very near future to debate these very important and urgent amendments to the Young Offenders Act . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed . )

criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , I am privileged to table in the House a private member ' s bill which will amend the Criminal Code to provide for the arrest of those in breach of condition of parole or statutory or temporary release . 
i again acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the Abbotsford city police , in particular Constable Mike Novakowski who provided the incentive and foresight to put this bill into force . 
this enactment makes a breach of a condition of parole or statutory or temporary release an indictable or summary conviction offence as is the case for breach of a probation order . 
paragraph 495 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Criminal Code allows a peace officer to arrest a person who has committed an indictable offence or who he finds committing a criminal offence . 
therefore this amendment enables a peace officer to arrest the person who is in breach of a condition of parole or release . 
the amendment to section 497 provides for such a person to be held , to give the board that granted the parole or release if the board considers it advisable an opportunity to apply to keep the person in custody until it is able to issue a warrant of apprehension to facilitate a review of the parole or release under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act .

criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , first I want to recognize and thank my hon. colleague from Blackstrap for seconding my bill . 
a Reform government would hold a binding national referendum on capital punishment . 
this Liberal government however refuses the people that much power . 
three times in the last Parliament I introduced this legislation and I will continue to do so until the government allows a real free vote on capital punishment where all MPs vote the wishes of their constituents . 
i believe that once convicted a murderer such as the Abbotsford killer should face a punishment that matches his crimes .

LOUIS RIEL DAY ACT 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 213 , an act respecting the designation of a Louis Riel Day and revoking his conviction of August 1 , 1885 . 
this time , however , the bill contains something new , which is to allow the designation of a Louis Riel Day in order to commemorate his memory everywhere in Canada on November 16 every year .

hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I move , seconded by the member for Langley - Abbotsford : 
that during the period ending December 10 , 1997 , the member proposing a motion on an allotted day shall not speak for more than 20 minutes , following which a period not exceeding 10 minutes shall be made available , if required , to allow members to ask questions and comment briefly on matters relevant to the speech and to allow responses thereto ; and 
immediately thereafter a representative of each of the recognized parties other than that of the member proposing the motion may be recognized to speak for not more than 10 minutes , following which in each case a period not exceeding 5 minutes shall be available , if required , to allow members to ask questions and comment briefly on matters relevant to the speech and to allow responses thereto . 
this motion has been negotiated with all House leaders , and I am pleased to propose it to the House .

petitions 
highways 
Mr. John Maloney ( Erie - Lincoln , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I am pleased to rise on behalf of the constituents of Erie - Lincoln and Niagara Centre to present two petitions , both on the same subject . 
the petitions call to the attention of parliament the fact that 38 percent of our national highway system is in disrepair . 
it also refers to the benefits of a national highway system such as job creation , economic development and , most important , the saving of lives and the avoidance of injuries . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i know the hon. member realizes he is not to express his agreement or disagreement with the petitions he tables . 
i would remind him of that rule . 
rights OF THE CHILD 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have quite a large number of petitions so I ask for your patience in introducing them . 
first I would like to present 87 petitions with the signatures of 2,035 Canadians from seven provinces . 
they are concerned that by ratifying and implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child that government bureaucrats and the courts , not parents , will be legally entitled to determine what is in the best interests of the child . 
the petitioners go on to say that Canada is creating a bureaucracy to police parents and enforce the guidelines in a UN charter , a charter that has never been approved by Parliament . 
not only are parental rights being undermined by implementing this UN convention , they are concerned it will create greater incentives for families to abdicate their parental responsibilities to the state . 
finally , your petitioners request Parliament to address their concerns by supporting my private member ' s motion No. 33 , which would include parental rights and responsibilities in the charter of rights and freedoms . 
criminal CODE 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am also pleased to present seven petitions with the signatures of 178 Canadians from Nova Scotia , Manitoba and British Columbia . 
these citizens of Canada support retention of section 43 of the Criminal Code which states " every schoolteacher , parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child who is under his care if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances '' . 
your petitioners request Parliament to affirm the duty of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their conscience and beliefs and retain section 43 in Canada ' s Criminal Code as it is currently worded . 
highways 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to table a petition that deals with the national highway system . 
it is sponsored by the Canadian Automobile Association .

government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Vaughan - King - Aurora , who I understand is splitting his time and has a 10 minute speech . 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua ( Vaughan - King - Aurora , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would first like to congratulate you on your role . 
as everyone in this House knows , you are one of the brightest minds in parliamentary procedure this House has ever seen . 
you rightly deserve your position . 
i would also like to thank the residents of Vaughan - King - Aurora for their vote of confidence in returning me to this House . 
it has been an honour and a privilege to have served them since 1988 and I look forward to serving them for many more years , working with them as their voice in Ottawa . 
this is a unique Parliament standing on the threshold of a new era . 
in his remarks this week , His Excellency the Governor General drew attention to the fact that we are the last Parliament of the 20 th century and the first of the 21 st century . 
an arbitrary boundary ? 
an important milestone ? 
if nothing else , it is an opportunity to pause and assess the state of our society . 
from that perspective all of us in this House have been entrusted with an important duty . 
we have been given the mandate by our electors to act as stewards of their interests as we cross the threshold into a new age . 
the decisions we make and the actions we take in the next four years will shape our society for decades to come . 
more importantly , they will decide what kind of nation Canada is as it begins a new century . 
the throne speech demonstrated that the government has a clear vision of where it would like to take this country in the course of this current mandate . 
the speech provides a clear outline of where the government intends to dedicate its efforts and most importantly , it unveiled an agenda that responds well to the suggestions and aspirations voiced by the residents of Vaughan - King - Aurora . 
they have made themselves heard on issues like national unity , technology and the new economy . 
they have participated in town hall meetings on health care , on the environment and on social programs . 
the government knows where the people of Vaughan - King - Aurora stand on such issues . 
it has been my pleasure to report to the House on 36 town hall meetings to date and a school speaking tour that included over 25,000 young people and literally thousands of meetings with groups and individuals . 
the Speech from the Throne with its emphasis on fiscal responsibility , with a promise to balance the budget by 1998 - 99 , on job creation with investments in key areas like technology , on quality health care with a plan to help Canadians who care for family members at home and on youth employment with a commitment to continue our successful internship and summer job programs to create real opportunities for our young people . 
these are the kinds of initiatives that the people of Vaughan - King - Aurora are looking for from the government . 
i am confident that this Speech from the Throne will meet with their approval as we gather for our first town hall meeting on the 36 th Parliament on October 1 . 
with that in mind , I want to take a minute to compare the throne speech that opened the 35 th Parliament and the one delivered on Tuesday . 
in 1994 the words were cautious , the commitments solemn . 
but this one was different . 
it was full of hope , optimism and excitement about what the future holds . 
the Governor General spoke of a country in control of its finances , ready to reinvest in its society and optimistic about its future . 
as someone who as worked on the issue of youth employment for a number of years , I am encouraged by the fact that for the third time in three months youth employment is up . 
this is the first period of sustained youth employment growth since May 1990 . 
the government ' s commitment to youth goes back to our days in opposition . 
in 1992 in the face of the indifference our predecessors showed toward youth issues , our party established a Senate - Commons committee on youth . 
through national public hearings we met with young people , teachers , parents , social workers and members of the business community . 
the end result was a final report entitled " Agenda for Youth " which laid out a number of steps the government would take to assist young Canadians . 
this three pronged approach has proven successful . 
since 1994 youth internship Canada has helped nearly 50,000 young people secure positions and gain professional experience . 
our figures show that two - thirds of them will find a job within one year of leaving the program , usually with the employer they interned with . 
sixty - eight percent of youth service Canada graduates either returned to school or found meaningful work within six months of completing their placement . 
over 60,000 youths participated in the 1997 student summer job action . 
in all , youth internship Canada , youth service Canada and the student summer job program have helped over one million young people since 1994 . 
we have introduced a number of measures designed to build on our commitment to helping Canada ' s youth . 
the youth employment strategy will give over 110,000 young Canadians work experience opportunities . 
the 1997 budget included measures designed to increase federal support for post - secondary education by approximately $ 137 million to make post - secondary education more accessible to young people . 
these programs and measures are only part of the solution . 
as I said earlier I have spent a great deal of my political career listening to Canadians across the country . 
i have found that the most innovative solutions come from young people . 
for this reason I encourage members of Parliament on both sides of the House to seek input from Canada ' s youth as we try to address the various challenges they face . 
our country is moving forward . 
the deficit is vanishing , interests rates are low , unemployment is decreasing , productivity is up and there is a new sense of optimism . 
we must all move forward together . 
when certain groups are shown to be more vulnerable than others , society has a responsibility to lend a helping hand . 
in our first mandate we began the work of dealing with youth unemployment . 
by renewing our mandate I believe Canadians are saying in part let us get back in there and finish the job . 
as a member of Parliament I have also seen success at the local level . 
last term I was one of the founders of the Vaughan Technology Enterprise Centre , a project that identifies young entrepreneurs with a knack for high tech and teaches them the necessary skills to compete in the business world . 
team Canada , a youth service Canada project , placed young people in local businesses seeking to expand their export potential . 
the youths explored emerging markets and designed a database of identified opportunities . 
i am confident that by working together and by pooling our resources and by committing to nothing less than success we will overcome this challenge . 
our youth will look to the future with confidence and enthusiasm as they should . 
as a postscript I note with interest that a number of young people were elected to this House in the last election . 
as someone who first entered this Chamber at the age of 28 , I salute their courage and their determination . 
i encourage them and all members to join together to deal with the many challenges facing our youth . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the hon. member for Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , perhaps I may finish the name of my riding , which is Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , representing its four regional county municipalities . 
i have a question which to me is entirely reasonable . 
this throne speech contains not a single reference to the fact that we should review the inequities in Canada ' s current employment insurance . 
a number of regressive measures were put into the system , the excuse being that there was not enough money , but by December 31 , 1997 there will be a surplus of $ 13 billion in the employment insurance fund . 
with a surplus of $ 13 billion , the government nevertheless reduces the number of weeks during which people will be entitled to receive employment insurance , especially seasonal workers . 
in its throne speech , the government said that compassion and generosity were the hallmarks of this country . 
but there was not a single word about redressing these inequities . 
however , if anyone should be aware of these inequities , it is the Liberal majority , because some of those who were here in the last Parliament , especially from the maritimes , and I am thinking of the Minister of Defence , are no longer here today . 
these are the people who paid the price for the fact that the Liberal majority did not listen to the public consultations that were held across Canada . 
the public wanted employment insurance reform but they wanted humane reform , the kind of reform that is a reflection of economic reality and gives regional economies a chance to diversify . 
does the hon. member not wonder why we are faced with this kind of situation today ? 
does he not feel like telling his government that it should act on the consensus reached by the ten provinces in Saint Andrews , where they asked for two things that were strangely similar to what the Bloc said in its campaign platform : a significant reduction in employment insurance premiums and improvements in the living conditions of seasonal workers and new labour market entrants ? 
is the hon. member prepared to tell his majority here in the House that all this is lacking in the throne speech and it should be corrected accordingly ? 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua : 
madam Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for his question . 
he was one of the most active members of the human resources development committee which I had the honour to chair in the last parliamentary session . 
i am quite surprised that the hon. member did not view some of the changes we made to the employment insurance program as improvements to the program . 
as the hon. member is fully aware , there have been great changes in the Canadian economy and with change also comes change to programs and institutions as they too must reflect the changing dynamics of our economy . 
in reference to lowering the premiums , the hon. member knows we have lowered premiums each year . 
if we followed the Conservative government ' s legislative timetable , the premiums would literally be going through the roof at this point . 
i draw the attention of the hon. member to the actuarial report that basically stated that this surplus is required in case of an economic downturn to offset any of the strain that that may place on the federal treasury . 
i want to also make it very clear that the reason why we have this so - called surplus is that we have learned from the mistakes of the previous government . 
what the previous government did during the last recession was increase the premiums precisely at the time when firms and employees required a relief in premiums . 
also , there is the fact that we have the fundamentals for the recovery well in place . 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I am splitting my time . 
the role of government is to provide a level of social order and progress that we cannot individually provide for ourselves . 
Canadians have expectations from government but they also have needs . 
therefore the government ' s throne speech in view of this reasonable standard is a disappointment , especially from a justice system perspective . 
it has been a long voyage for society , from tribalism to this Canadian Parliament . 
we indeed have accomplishments in Canada . 
we have built a country out of a harsh but bountiful land . 
however nation building is a passage , not an arrival . 
canada must continue to live , renew and flourish . 
we must respect and nurture what has given us life by regarding basic principles . 
unfortunately a downward spiral of cynicism has gripped many . 
they have given up on politicians because they have come to believe that average Canadians are too powerless to change anything as large , amorphous and detached as the way things are done in political Canada . 
in the current context of this House , the throne speech is said to outline the vision of the new government . 
however our society needs both sustenance and a hope to go forward . 
the throne speech sadly is a mere chart for interim crew duty on the ship of state and not a bold course for our ship to sail through the winds of change . 
the Liberals have charted a course with their statement . 
if it is a vision at all , it looks like we are sailing into the fog with faulty forecasts , with a ship they have not maintained and with an ill - prepared crew . 
the bunch cannot be trusted . 
Canadian democracy as imperfect as it is has nominated this Liberal crew and they have now tried to reassure us in this throne speech that we are on a voyage somewhere . 
there is a proverb that says that where there is no vision , the people perish , but he that keepeth the law , happy is he . 
where there is no vision , the people get out of hand ; blessed are they who keep the precept . 
where there is no revelation , the people cast off restraint ; but blessed is he who keeps the law . 
another proverb says that righteousness exalteth the nation , but sin is a reproach to any people . 
i have risen to respond to the throne speech because I care deeply about our country and I despair at the kind of leadership and competence observed from the government . 
many Canadians watching here today do not feel very good about politics . 
they have become very cynical about politicians and the process of elections . 
they do not know who they can trust . 
however , I say that we can launch out , guided by love for our country , our community and a sincere concern for our neighbour . 
joined together for the common good , we can discover what we can give to build this country rather than just calculate what we can get from the government which are really just other taxpayers . 
it could be so much better . 
Canadians do not ask for the impossible . 
they have reasonable expectations for their representatives . 
although historical deference to Parliament is gone , Canadians basically expect three things : they want members of Parliament simply to be honest , to be competent and to have some leadership qualities to inspire . 
it is basic principles that matter , for by living by principles and receiving the humility that comes from them , we are empowered to learn from our history , act with confidence in the present and have vision for the future . 
first we want our politicians to be honest . 
we want leaders to be forthright and have character . 
we want to be able to believe and trust what we hear . 
integrity in political life must come first . 
therefore on this point do the Liberals have any integrity left in view of what they did to the Somalia inquiry ? 
second , Canadians want competence . 
we want politicians who are qualified to look after our national affairs and to have depth of wisdom and a commitment to principles . 
when there are no easy answers forthcoming on the issue of the day , it has been said that federal politics is conflict resolution at the national level but it is also taking care of the business of the country in a wise manner for the long term welfare of future generations , not short term special interests or for only those who currently have the inside track . 
we have much incompetence in government . 
therefore we need our leaders to be competent , to be able to get Canadians to pull together and then wisely administer . 
however , on the topic of competent governance , we have a prime minister who has never given the country a balanced budget or had the courage to stem the rising tide of hurtful taxation . 
and now he wants to lead a spending charge again . 
in Canada the crime rate is too high . 
victims are still not paramount in law and the Young Offenders Act remains in disrepute with the public and the provinces only have the broken promises of YOA funding . 
tragic 745 hearings continue to tear communities apart . 
our youth are enticed through a wide open legal door into prostitution and the supply of dangerous drugs has not been stemmed . 
immigration fails to protect our borders and Canada is embarrassed before the world with the existence of the slavery pipeline . 
federal jails cannot seem to hold dangerous offenders and we cannot even prosecute war criminals . 
that is the sorry Liberal administrative record . 
they are not competent . 
third , Canadians desire real leadership . 
we need inspiration and leaders who can lift us up . 
we need real leaders who can look beyond today and inspire us with a vision of substance of a better Canada , with hope and real belief that we can do so much better than what we have politically . 
after hearing the feel good banalities of the throne speech , does any Canadian really feel inspired and believe that we are being wisely led or being protected from the criminal and given community peace ? 
public acceptance for what the courts give is at an all time low . 
however , there is a reformist alternative of democratic free market principles that rigorously defends equality of opportunity , denies discrimination in any form to keep a foothold and trusts the common sense of average Canadians to do what is right and just for the country . 
average Canadians can be trusted to do what is right for the country if they are told the complete truth and are finally given real political power . 
reformers strive for responsible and accountable government rather than merely the current representative government . 
i come back to three things in respect of vision for the country , honesty , competence and leadership . 
i am part of an honest , sincere group of colleagues who are competent and ready to govern and who are ready to inspire to take this country to a new level of democratic freedom , justice and social and economic prosperity . 
on leadership , I remind my colleagues in the House that there is a vision of a new Canada . 
it is an exciting vision of a country that can finally become fully democratic and forever put aside the injustices from the old line political parties . 
we have a vision of a new Canada . 
someday it will voters themselves who will decide how our country is run rather than four or five year dictatorships . 
someday all Canadians will truly be equal when there are no more special deals for categories , groups and insiders . 
someday the justice system will represent mainstream Canadian values where we protect our children and properly denounce discrimination and violence . 
someday the federal government will be an enabler rather than an oppressive tax taker . 
we can lead the way from the scourge of unemployment , for a good crime prevention program is low unemployment . 
someday we will shape a federation that is attractive enough for the discontented who say they want to separate to want to stay be fulfilled , lest they are left behind our dynamic and yet diverse society . 
i say we can protect our children from the criminal . 
we can support those who need our help , not with another handout but with a hand up . 
we can finally say to the world community that Canada is a haven of freedom where we can be secure in our homes and have every opportunity to be fully engaged in the building of our national home . 
we can make our country fit for heroes to live in . 
our opposition benches will do their part to lead us to that new Canada . 
we will compliment the wise government policy , criticize the bad and propose constructive alternatives . 
in conclusion , I say that the vision for the national voyage must be based on honesty , competence and leadership . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I would like to congratulate you on your position as Acting Speaker of the House . 
it is an honourable position , which I am sure you know . 
we extend our thanks to you in advance for your impartiality , your fairness and the important role which you will play in keeping us all in order and on topic . 
with respect to the topic today , we have been spending quite a bit of time on this side of the House talking about justice issues . 
today I was able to table a private member ' s bill which deals with a problem in my riding , joy riding . 
in August when the justice minister was before the bar association she spent some time detailing her priorities for the coming session . 
she said that her priorities were changes to the Young Offenders Act , that she would toughen it up and make it tighter . 
she said that she would deal with Canadians ' concerns that the Young Offenders Act has become a leaking sieve rather than a catch basin which would look after our justice problems . 
last , I remember her saying clearly that she was going to deal with victim rights . 
none of those things are in the throne speech . 
that is why the Reform Party today has spent a good deal of its time questioning the government about its priorities and about its sincerity in dealing with the issues that the new justice minister said in August were going to be the priorities of this government . 
that is why we see the alternative package . 
the Reform member who just spoke gave a global picture of what is wrong with the justice system . 
he talked about the theoretical problems , the problems that will plague the government until it fixes them . 
he also talked about some of the principles which guide us . 
i know he has extensive personal experience in the field . 
this is not simply a theoretical exercise for him . 
he has experience dealing with juveniles , working in the justice system , and he has some expertise and some inside knowledge of what needs to be fixed in the justice system . 
i wonder if the hon. member would like to expand a bit more on his thoughts on what needs to be done , with some specificity , so that we can take those ideas to heart , knowing his expertise . 
Mr. Paul Forseth : 
madam Speaker , in the brief 10 minutes I was given I did touch , in broad generalities , about confidence in government , integrity and so forth . 
there was a social context in my riding , and in most cities of this country , where street prostitution was not pervasive because there was a legal context which prohibited it . 
we may not ever remove the problem of prostitution from our society , but the law changed and capacity creates its own demand . 
when this Parliament made the mistakes and changed the law , we now have street prostitution from one end of the country to the other . 
one specific one that appears to have agreement from all attorneys general across the country is simply communicating for the purposes of obtaining sexual services in a public place . 
that specific offence should not merely be a summarial offence but it should be a hybrid offence . 
it should be an electable offence . 
this is a very minor first step and I introduced a private member ' s bill specific to this . 
it is time we begin to take some steps that all provinces across the country are asking for . 
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I am honoured to have this opportunity to respond to the throne speech , but first let me take this opportunity to thank the voters of Surrey North for showing their confidence in me . 
being new to this place I do not really know whether to be optimistic or cynical . 
like most Canadians , I continue to have hope that each new Parliament will be an improvement but fear that we will again be disappointed when our government proceeds for political reasons rather than for the best interest for Canadians . 
as an example , it did not take the previous minister of justice long to advance his gun control legislation , even though he did not bother to determine whether and how registration would discourage the criminal misuse of firearms . 
he stated repeatedly that he had consulted and that he had the support of Canadians . 
perhaps he consulted with his leader ' s imaginary homeless friends because our aboriginal peoples consistently claim that they were not consulted , even though their treaty rights would be significantly affected . 
consultation with the various provincial authorities is also in question , as four provinces and two territories are presently before the courts challenging our federal government on this legislation . 
in this week ' s throne speech the government talked of partnerships . 
it now states that the federal government cannot act alone . 
it is indeed unfortunate that the previous government did not understand this concept . 
then we have victim rights . 
on April 29 , 1996 , after encouragement and pressure from the Reform Party , the former minister of justice stated in this House : " Although steps have been made toward progress in recent years , they have been imperfect . 
there remains a great deal to be done '' . 
he promised to address this deficiency in our laws . 
it may come as a surprise but this hon. member either would not or could not carry through on his promise . 
we must assume one of two things . 
either it was not a priority on his personal political agenda or he was overruled . 
regardless , Canadians are still waiting . 
it was with great disappointment that I noticed the almost complete absence of any substance toward rectifying the inadequacies of our criminal justice system in the throne speech . 
it is hoped that this government ' s priorities on justice have been inadvertently forgotten . 
otherwise Canadians will also be greatly disappointed . 
we now have a fresh new Minister of Justice . 
once again Canadians anticipate the introduction and passage of much needed legislation . 
hopefully she will be able to fulfil her promises regarding violent young offenders and victims of crime . 
hopefully she will be interested in the pursuit of what is right for Canadians rather than what is right for the Liberal Party . 
in the past Parliament many of the members opposite were most interested in passing legislation to provide alternative methods of sentencing . 
for example , Bill C - 41 permitted conditional sentencing which , while useful in some cases , is applicable to even those who violently offend within our communities . 
bill C - 53 extended temporary absence provisions and Bill C - 37 actually reduced the parole ineligibility for young offenders convicted of second degree murder in adult court . 
but what did the government do for victims , those who have not deliberately decided to offend society ' s rules but just happen to be in the wrong place and the wrong time ? 
i have made my home in British Columbia since 1971 . 
it is where my wife and I met 29 years ago , where we raised our family , where we work and where we pay our taxes . 
although my hometown of North Bay is not far from here , each time I fly here I pass directly over the place of my youth . 
last week I was able to pick out the beaches where I swam , the wharf where I fished and the streets where I walked , played and cycled . 
i could not help but to think about that young man growing up and the twists and turns his life would take over the next 40 years which would put him in a jet plane flying to a seat in this House of Commons . 
my life was not that much different from the lives of most Canadians of my generation . 
violent crime was something we read or heard about , tragic events that happened to others . 
the next week in Courtenay , B.C. a six - year old girl was sexually assaulted and murdered by a sixteen - year old neighbour who was on probation for molesting a young child one year earlier . 
the anonymity provisions of the Young Offenders Act precluded neighbours from knowing the threat he posed . 
two weeks later in my community two women were butchered by a man who , because he said he was stoned on cocaine , received 10 years for manslaughter . 
he applied for parole last March . 
the grass is barely green on the graves of his victims , one of whom was pregnant while the other left three young children . 
the youngest , at the tender age of four years witnessed his mother ' s killing . 
barely three months had passed before a Surrey doctor facing a hearing for sexual impropriety had the young complainant murdered . 
the hit man was free on bail after shooting a man in the face six months earlier . 
our family spent nearly two years before the courts . 
we have come to know many families of victims of violent crime and have followed many of their cases . 
it did not take very long to realize that our system of justice is seriously out of kilter . 
shortly after our son ' s murder we founded an organization to support victims and to work for justice reform through public education . 
time is not sufficient to detail our efforts but suffice to say that it was the way in which I was treated by the justice committee of the previous Parliament during its hearings on the youth justice system which propelled me into this arena . 
it was painfully clear that the previous government was not prepared to listen to the views of ordinary Canadians . 
i have come to the House of Commons with the support of my constituents . 
along with representing their interests in this institution , they have given me a specific mandate to achieve better recognition for innocent victims of crime and reform of the criminal justice system . 
for too long society has dealt with justice as merely a jurisdiction between the state and the offender , the philosophy that an offence against the laws of our land is an offence against the state . 
little regard is given to the specific damage done to individual law - abiding citizens . 
this must change , not merely because it may be politically advantageous but because it is right , because it is fair and because it is what real justice is all about . 
i am serving notice that I fully intend to be particularly vigilant on this issue . 
i realize that my task will be difficult as politicians of the past have been known to talk a good game , promising advancements in flowery complicated legal wording . 
but legislation to do any real good for our communities must have substance . 
it must be made more accessible , more equitable and more sympathetic toward victims of crime . 
i am hopeful that the present Minister of Justice will set her fellow Canadians at ease by being a breath of fresh air and being a saviour not of the rights of our criminals but of the rights of our innocent victims . 
i am also hopeful that this new minister will be much more successful in her consultations and negotiations with the provinces . 
a great deal of victims legislation will have to be co - ordinated with those provinces , which have the task of administering our criminal law . 
funding for these services to victims will be of utmost interest and it is hoped this minister will use her persuasive powers to encourage the government to adequately provide those resources . 
she has promised a policy of co - operation with the provinces . 
she has assured us that victims of crime will be accorded better treatment within our justice system . 
it is noted that she promised victims better treatment but at the same time denies them and the majority of Canadians their demand to repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code . 
obviously we will have to work to convince her in that regard . 
i personally attended Clifford Olson ' s 745 hearing . 
there are few words available with which to describe it . 
mockery and travesty come to mind . 
those who crafted section 745 and those who support it should hang their heads in shame . 
the Reform Party has been the most active in recognizing victims ' rights . 
it is one of the primary reasons why I chose to run in the recent election for Reform . 
victims of crime desire no special rights for themselves , only due consideration . 
victims rights are about balance and fairness , nothing more and nothing less . 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , the member made specific reference to the loss of his son but he talked about the particular offender in that regard , and a peculiar gap in the law . 
then he mentioned parallel examples of other individuals who committed heinous crimes while they were already before the justice system on other matters . 
i believe he has introduced a private member ' s bill related to that . 
i would like him to expand on this issue where we have individuals who are law breakers , who are in process . 
the justice system should be aware of them and yet it is inadequate , apparently , to stop their cycle of offending while they are still before the courts . 
Mr. Chuck Cadman : 
madam Speaker , I can relate to the business that the hon. member mentioned . 
there is a section that holds parents accountable for failing to supervise an undertaking . 
in in my particular case , this came into play because the father did undertake to supervise a curfew condition that was , obviously , not supervised properly . 
it was not followed through in the courts . 
it never is . 
it could have been . 
right now it is a summary offence . 
we would like to see that moved into something more of an indictable area . 
situations like that force the families of victims of violence - in particular murder victims - into the civil courts which is something that we really do not feel they should have to go . 
that is not a route that should be taken . 
it is just one extra roadblock on the way to recovery . 
we feel many of these things have to be done through the criminal courts , not the civil courts . 
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I want to add my own congratulations to you on your appointment as one of our deputy speakers and look forward to your very fair and impartial judgments on our deliberations . 
as a fellow colleague from the coast and Vancouver Island I have , of course , much sympathy for what the hon. member for Surrey North has been sharing with us this afternoon . 
we were all treated to that terrible travesty of justice recently where Clifford Olson was brought into our living rooms by television and other means to plead his case for early parole . 
it is the insensitivity of the government that has allowed this kind of thing to happen in Canadian society . 
i have a question for my hon. colleague . 
i wonder if , in view of the tragic circumstances that his family has endured in the past few years , he has any light to shed on whether or not the penal system in this country does rehabilitate criminals . 
Mr. Chuck Cadman : 
madam Speaker , there is certainly a place within the criminal justice system , within the corrections system , for rehabilitation . 
i for one do not believe it works all the time . 
in fact in most cases when dealing with serious violent offenders , with sexual predators , it has been shown that it does not work . 
there have been any number of instances of that over the past number of years . 
it has been argued that the incarceration periods for young offenders are far too short to instil any positive corrective behaviour . 
you cannot take someone who has committed a murder , and is seriously off the rails , incarcerate them in a youth detention centre for five or six years and expect to get them turned around . 
it just does not work . 
Mr. Allan Kerpan ( Blackstrap , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , first I would like to congratulate my colleague on his maiden speech . 
if more members of Parliament would take to heart his words of advice we would certainly have a better institution and a far better country . 
i would ask the hon. member to comment on the area of victims rights . 
he mentioned in his remarks the 745 hearings . 
there has been no closure . 
would the hon. member like to comment ? 
Mr. Chuck Cadman : 
madam Speaker , after sitting through Clifford Olson ' s section 745 hearing for four days , there are really no words to describe it . 
you had to be there . 
it was an absolute travesty . 
there were 22 family members representing eight of his 11 victims . 
it was beyond comprehension what those families were put through in those four days . 
it is not much more than what any family goes through when dealing with a parole hearing . 
however , in the case of a section 745 hearing , at one point a judge said " life with no parole for 20 " but these families were forced to deal with it at 15 years . 
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the member for St. Paul ' s . 
i am pleased to take part in today ' s debate on the Speech from the Throne , but before beginning , Madam Speaker , I too want to congratulate you on your appointment as Acting Speaker of the House , and to wish you good luck . 
on June 2 of this year , I began my second term of office , this time as the member for Ahuntsic , in the riding where I have lived with my family for close to 30 years . 
the riding of Ahuntsic has a long Liberal tradition , and I take great pride in following in the steps of women like the Hon. Jeanne Sauv é and Th é r è se Killens . 
Canadians are optimistic . 
we are once again in a position to meet Canadians ' priorities without exceeding our financial means . 
the result is that we can now make strategic investments for our children , our young people , our health , and our communities , as well as for the sector of knowledge and creativity . 
during our first mandate we demonstrated the leadership Canadians expect from their federal government . 
that is why Canadians returned their confidence on June 2 by electing a Liberal government to lead them into the 21 st century . 
we have restored their optimism and renewed their hope for the future . 
we were not mean , as some of our opponents will have you believe , but we were lean . 
we were not pseudo - conservatives as others would have you believe , we were true liberals . 
i will quote a great Canadian who led this country into another century , Sir Wilfrid Laurier : 
i am a Liberal of the English school . 
i believe in that school which has all along claimed that it is the privilege of all subjects , whether high or low , whether rich or poor , whether ecclesiastic or laymen , to participate in the administration of public affairs , to discuss , to influence , to persuade , to convince - but which has always denied , even to the highest , the right to dictate to the lowest . 
that is what Liberalism is all about . 
we also know that the government cannot act alone . 
Canadians want their government to work in partnership . 
we are ready to work with all our partners - the provinces and territories , the private sector , non profit agencies , the volunteer sector and all Canadians - to better equip our country to meet the needs of Canadians . 
we are not trying to encroach on the fundamental rights of the provinces , as the Bloc Quebecois is accusing us of doing , but rather to help my province , Quebec , develop within this flexible federation . 
a more smoothly operating federation is the key to our future . 
a federation is not static , but rather constantly changing . 
together we will decide how it will change . 
the Speech from the Throne sets out the broad lines of our strategy for our second mandate . 
job creation and economic growth are and will remain our first priorities . 
accordingly , we want to keep our efforts focussed on helping small and medium size business develop and market new technologies . 
small and medium size businesses need to make the transition to new technologies if they are to survive in today ' s market . 
this new project will help to create nearly 200 jobs in Ahuntsic . 
this initiative funded through the transitional job fund is an example of the success of our job creation commitment , and that is just one example in my riding . 
investing in our youth has the largest return for Canada . 
as a mother of two young girls this issue is of utmost importance to me personally and I believe to all my colleagues in the House . 
we need to give children the best start possible . 
during our first mandate we established a prenatal program and increased the Canada child tax benefit by $ 850 million a year . 
in our second mandate we will continue to develop a national child benefit system to respond to the problems of low income families with children . 
we will also develop a national children ' s agenda and establish centres of excellence to deepen our understanding of children ' s development and well - being . 
who can argue with that ? 
we must do everything to guarantee our young people a better future . 
the youth service corps and youth internship programs were hugely successful in our first mandate . 
i had a number of projects in my riding and I can testify to their impact on the development of young people . 
young people want to gain experience in order to overcome the obstacles blocking their entry into the labour market . 
furthermore , this experience revives their self confidence and increases their worth with future employers . 
the youth employment strategy and the public service youth internship program will also create opportunities for young people in the riding of Ahuntsic and for the students of the coll è ge Bois - de - Boulogne , who will certainly benefit from these programs . 
finally , the $ 1 billion Canada millennium scholarship endowment fund that the Prime Minister announced yesterday in response to the Speech from the Throne demonstrates once again our commitment to helping young Canadians . 
i would like to congratulate the Prime Minister on behalf of all our children and on behalf of my daughters . 
these programs go a long way in helping our youth reach their potential and making them responsible citizens in their communities . 
there is nothing sadder than seeing youth resort to crime in the absence of hope for their future . 
during my first mandate I worked directly with street kids and youth workers and saw firsthand the problems our youth are facing today . 
i bring these experiences to my new role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada . 
i thank the prime minister for giving me that opportunity . 
our focus in our second mandate will be crime prevention , youth justice and victim rights . 
by investing in crime prevention we are investing in the future of our children and ensuring safer streets and communities . 
the throne speech announced an increase in funding for community based crime prevention initiatives to $ 30 million a year , further demonstrating our commitment to helping communities deal with the roots of crime . 
it also announced the government ' s intention to develop alternatives to incarceration for low risk , non - violent offenders such as sentencing reforms , community diversion programs and alternative sentencing . 
my goal in my second mandate is to continue to serve my constituents and Canadians with honesty and integrity , as this government has shown , to remain accessible and approachable to those I represent and finally to remind them of the important role they play in shaping Canada ' s public policy . 
as a Canadian of Hellenic origins , I take particular pride in knowing that the ancient Hellenic ideals of democracy and the agora are continuing to thrive in Canada because of this government . 
as Aristotle once said , if liberty and equality are chiefly to be found in a democracy , they will be best obtained when all persons alike share in the government to the utmost . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
thank you , Madam Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and congratulate you on your appointment . 
i want to assure you of my full co - operation . 
i cannot resist the temptation to put , through you , a question to our colleague , who is from Montreal and represents a constituency similar to mine in that there are very specific concerns about Montreal . 
my question to the hon. member , which I hope she will answer , is this : 
does she recognize that 20 years ago we were in a situation where the three leading federal parties - we tend to forget this , but a little over 20 years ago the Conservative Party , the NDP and the Liberal Party did recognize the existence of two nations or peoples in Canada . 
why is it then that , for one reason or another , today , only lip service is paid to Quebec as a people or a nation , particularly on that side of the House ? 
is there cause for concern ? 
i would like to ask my hon. colleague , through you , if she recognizes Quebec as a people . 
there are few examples of federations in the world - and the hon. member sitting next to me is an expert on these issues - where one nation clearly has control over a territory , as is the case in Quebec . 
when we talk about peoples and nations , it always involves a clearly defined judicial system , as is the case in Quebec . 
these terms imply a will to live together , and the hon. member for Bourassa is aware of these issues . 
all the objective elements are present so that the word " nations " can be used in the plural . 
yet , some newspapers and political parties persist in their use of the singular form . 
will the hon. member recognize , here in this House , that Quebecers are a people , that they have a right to self - determination , and that we can count on her , should tempers flare in the coming weeks , particularly in Montreal , to discuss the issue of partition ? 
i know the hon. member will be by my side and will say that Quebecers are a people , that they form a nation , that Quebec has a right to self - determination , and that its territory must remain intact . 
am I to understand that we will fight together for the same cause ? 
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos : 
madam Speaker , I thank my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois for a question which is dear to my heart , since it is a given that I have been actively involved in Quebec politics for 25 years . 
i consider myself a Quebecer , and I am one , although not Quebec - born . 
what I wish to say is that , when the hon. member talks history , he must not forget that the two founding peoples include French Canadians throughout Canada , and not just in Quebec . 
we must never forget that there are French Canadians outside Quebec . 
i will repeat what I said in my speech . 
if the hon. member has listened well , what I said was that we must work together for a federation that will be more modern and more democratic , and will include all Canadians from the Atlantic to the Pacific . 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I note with the background of the member who just spoke that she probably exemplifies where we are in Canada , which is that indeed Canada is made up of all those in Canada , not just those from the so - called two founding nations . 
that is noteworthy . 
my question to her concerns her being Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice . 
i had occasion to have some people insist on having a discussion with me because someone they were associated with had been convicted of first degree murder 15 years ago . 
at that time the judge said it was an awful crime . 
i could see that in the eyes of these people when they met with me . 
these people are petrified at the potential of this killer being set free after 15 years . 
at the sentencing hearing the judge said that it was such an awful crime there was no way the killer should be paroled for 25 years . 
i have a question for the parliamentary secretary , as she will be the person who will be backing up the justice minister . 
this is a very serious question on behalf of these very distraught people . 
why should we believe in today ' s court judgments when the judges and the juries clearly say this is the penalty that must be applied because of the severity of the crime ? 
why should be believe in the judgment and in the sentencing that happens in 1997 if the judge says there should be no parole for 25 years , such as in the awful case of Bernardo ? 
why should we believe that our courts are going to be able to actually see that done ? 
does the fact that her government refused to repeal section 745 not put the judgments and the sentencing of today ' s - 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice . 
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos : 
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
as has been evident in the House , the Reform Party ' s vision of the justice system is totally different from the vision which we as Liberals have . 
we do not question the integrity of our justice system . 
in our first mandate we toughened sentences for those convicted of hate crimes . 
we tightened the rules for early parole hearings . 
we enhanced longer sentences for young offenders convicted of first and second degree murder . 
we made it possible to obtain DNA samples from suspects in crimes of physical violence . 
we cracked down on child prostitution and child sex tourism . 
i think that is proof enough that this government is going in the right direction and the integrity of our justice system is not put in question . 
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , congratulations on your appointment . 
as I assume my responsibilities as the member for St. Paul ' s , I want to thank my predecessor , Barry Campbell , for his hard work both in the riding and for his invaluable help as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance . 
i am also honoured to have his ongoing support and guidance as I enter this exciting new chapter . 
i also want to thank his staff , Michael Spowart and Esther Shron for staying with me and providing the seamless transition for the people of St. Paul ' s with their ongoing care and experience . 
the people of St. Paul ' s are big picture people . 
they are knowledgeable , passionate and have high expectations of their member of Parliament . 
Mitchell Sharp , John Roberts and Barry Campbell have set a high standard that I hope to be able to live up to . 
throughout the election campaign , it was clear to me that the people of St. Paul ' s respected the Liberal record of fiscal responsibility . 
we have been elected to continue our prudent fiscal management , but make sure that we are able to be compassionate and look after those less fortunate . 
the people of Canada elected a Liberal government with a real plan : first eliminate the deficit , then divide the surplus between reinvesting in programs and a combination of tax relief and debt reduction , a balanced approach . 
the people of Ontario strongly rejected the tax cuts and survival of the fittest option . 
we are living every day with the consequences of a provincial government which has no vision nor values ; a government that continues to transfer power to unelected officials and ignores public opinion and referenda ; a government that does not believe that it can have a positive effect on people ' s lives and whose sole purpose is to cut taxes ; a government that forgets that Canada is a big cold country and as John Ralston Saul has said , a country whose people agreed over 150 years ago that they would have to look after one another . 
the true vision and values of Canadians are Liberal values . 
i have been surprised and overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and innovation present in our public service and their clear commitment to real partnerships . 
yesterday at the Industry Canada open house I was thrilled to see Schoolnet and Strategis as realities , to see the national graduates registry actually putting young Canadians to work on the digital collections and consulting small business . 
it is quite clear that our young Canadians ' real facility with technology will be the true leveller in our society . 
the CEOs of this country are really learning directly from the recent grads . 
i had the opportunity to see first hand last week one of the youth initiatives at HRDC . 
their award winning newspaper Canada Prospects is really talking to high school students in language they can relate to and it is working . 
i was privileged to represent the minister at the launch of HRDC ' s new program , career in a box , creating a partnership between the federal government , the packaging industry and the CEC union . 
hopefully this example of partnership will provide a template for which other sectors can soon follow . 
organizations like ACTEW and Skills for Change in my riding embody the vision and values and have the expertise to help realize the potential of those highly motivated Canadians who would truly rather be working . 
as a family physician , my patients and now my constituents have made me acutely aware that they are increasingly concerned that the health care they need may not be there when they need it . 
in Ontario the present restructuring is putting at risk the high quality care that Canadians wear as a badge of honour . 
i support the establishment of the health transition fund that will help provincial governments innovate in the areas of primary care and provide more integration in the delivery of health services and innovative home care and pharmacare . 
by finally moving forward with health care reform we can hopefully begin to ameliorate the damage done by the closing of hospitals and old - fashioned mergers before resources have been properly placed into community care . 
by improving the health information system , we will finally be able to track outcomes and ensure the kind of accountability that is required in order to support what up until now has only been supported anecdotally . 
throughout North America , health institutions are sharing services , saving dollars and proving that restructuring can be done without destroying institutions like Women ' s College Hospital and eroding public confidence in the system . 
in my former role as host of Doctor On Call on WTN , I was shocked at the disparity of health care across the country . 
it is only with the facts that we will finally be able to address the inequities . 
the tenets of the Canada Health Act presumed high quality care . 
accessibility to bargain basement standards is not what was intended nor what Canadians expect . 
these new initiatives will ensure increased accountability and real measurements of quality such that we can restore the confidence of Canadians in their health care system . 
we can no longer tolerate benchmarks that are not based on quality . 
in Ontario sending people home from hospital quicker and sicker is what seems to be rewarded . 
we know the data is flawed and we know that readmission rates are not being tracked and that the women of this country are being left to pick up the pieces when patients are sent home too sick to look after themselves . 
we need to measure the absenteeism of those working women and the real cost to our country . 
some companies are already convinced that partnerships in home care for their employees is just plain good business . 
health care delivery may be a provincial responsibility but there is no question in my mind that all Canadians hold us , the federal government , responsible for the existence and the quality of our health care system . 
for me the sustainability of the health care system is reliant upon the recognition of all the determinants of health : jobs and poverty , violence and crime prevention , the environment . 
throughout the summer my constituents have already been reassured by the efforts of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to bring frankness and clarity to any debate that could put in jeopardy the future of this country . 
they too believe that our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding . 
the issue of national unity continues to be of paramount importance to the residents of St. Paul ' s . 
madam Speaker , I would like to thank you and your office personally for the excellent opportunity that your office provided at the centre d ' immersion at Saint - Jean - sur - Richelieu . 
it helped me become a little more comfortable in our other official language . 
i also felt that the exposure to Madam Gervais and her staff with their frank conversations helped me to better understand the point of view that will be important to the future of a united Canada . 
this experience and exposure has been invaluable to me as a member of Parliament and has allowed me already to help explain to the people of St. Paul ' s the need for even greater understanding . 
i recommend that all Canadians take any opportunity they can to visit Quebec . I hope this sort of exchange among all provinces will become a focus for some of our millennium celebrations . 
as we move toward the millennium I feel extremely proud to be a Canadian . 
last week I had the opportunity to speak to the Canadian Publishers Association which was entertaining a delegation of 20 Japanese publishers . 
i was asked to help them differentiate between Canadians and Americans . 
i focused on two things , both highlighted in the Speech from the Throne : our commitment to look after one another and our respect for multiculturalism . 
American author John Irving who with his Canadian wife has an apartment in St. Paul ' s , pointed out that it is the expectation of the Canadian social system to look after the people who cannot look after themselves . 
there is also the wonderful Canadian nurse who looked after the English patient . 
we are different . 
i am so proud to be married to Peter O ' Brian who with his films such as Grey Fox and My American Cousin continues to find and produce films that tell our stories . 
our respect for diversity also makes us different . 
i suggest that perhaps the publishing industry has demonstrated such success because of its recognition of the tremendous talent of our Canadians with roots around the world : 
as we move into this exciting new chapter , I am honoured to be part of a government that has accepted the challenge `` to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward '' . 
i thank my husband and my sons for making my decision such an easy one and I thank my parents for their commitment of hard work and commitment to the customer . 
being a member of Parliament is truly the greatest privilege and responsibility . 
politics and the opportunity to be part of a good government that can make a real difference in people ' s lives is indeed the highest calling . 
i promise that I will do everything in my power to continue to earn the trust the people of St. Paul ' s have placed in me . 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , I found it rather unusual that in the member ' s speech she mentioned health care in Ontario , and of how people are sent back home too soon as if it was just happening in Ontario . 
i guess I just wanted to make members aware that this has been happening in the Atlantic provinces for quite a long time , having been , myself , a statistic of that . 
i had a child 22 months ago . 
she was born on Wednesday and Friday morning I was out . 
Friday night I was back in with my daughter . 
believe me it is not only the problem of the premier of Ontario . 
it is actually the federal government ' s problem because of the cuts transferred to the provinces . 
i want to make it clear that it is happening in the Atlantic provinces . 
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett : 
madam Speaker , I am aware that this is a problem across the country . 
i believe it is not the fault of the transfer payment cuts which I think were very necessary in order to be able to reduce the interest payments and for us to continue to do good work . 
i do think , though , that the federal government has an ability to track these kinds of outcomes and be able to set some standards that all provinces can then set as true accountability for their performance . 
we do not really know the readmission rate of maternity patients . 
we do not really know the readmission rate of people being sent home from hospital too early . 
we need to know those statistics so that we know where to reinvest and how to set examples for excellent quality care . 
Ms. Angela Vautour : 
madam Speaker , I guess what I would like to know then is how are the Liberals planning on finding out those statistics ?

government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me begin by welcoming you to your new position . 
i know that you will bring distinction to the Chair as you have as a critic for your party in the past . 
as I recall , part of the time you were criticising my portfolio , but always in a very positive and constructive way . 
i would also like to take the opportunity to thank the constituents of my riding of Ottawa South for re - electing me for a third term . 
it is a great honour to be able to represent them again here in the House of Commons . 
i am also grateful to the Prime Minister for giving me the opportunity to continue as Minister of Industry . 
in fulfilling this role over the last four years , I have had the opportunity to meet with business people across Canada in all sectors of industry . 
i have had a unique opportunity to see firsthand the entrepreneurship and dynamism of Canadians at work from coast to coast . 
i am entirely enthusiastic about my portfolio and proud of the public servants who work in it with me . 
my objective today , in setting out the government ' s program to this House , is to explain our vision of Canada ' s economic and social development in a global knowledge - based economy . 
what our government set out in the Speech from the Throne is nothing more and nothing less than a new economic framework for Canada , a framework based on one idea : seizing the opportunities presented by the global knowledge economy in order to create jobs and wealth in all economic sectors , ranging from high technology to services and primary resources . 
with our vision we will bring into the XXI century a Canada that is united and built on solid economic and social foundations . 
our vision will bring Canadians , ourselves included , face to face with the challenge of being the best in the world . 
a new global economy based on knowledge , technology and innovation is rapidly emerging . 
led by dramatic improvements in computing and communications , this knowledge based economy is changing the determinants of success for individuals , companies , regions and countries . 
it is breaking the barriers of time and distance , and it is magnifying the role international developments play in our prosperity . 
these changes are allowing individuals and businesses to operate across borders , around the world , at the speed of light : sharing knowledge , trading in goods , services and capital 24 hours a days , 7 days a week . 
in this emerging new economy , more than ever people and innovations are the keys to growth and wealth creation . 
the knowledge economy is transforming all industrial sectors from agriculture and natural resources through manufacturing to retail and services . 
as we move into the new century the new economy will affect the life and work of every person , every business , every community and every organization in Canada . 
there is no question that change goes hand and hand with uncertainty . 
the changing world of work and the introduction of new technologies have left many wondering whether they and their children will occupy a productive and rewarding place in the new economy . 
but change goes hand in hand with new opportunities . 
in an economy based on knowledge and innovation , many Canadians see outlets for their ideas and new horizons for their children . 
they see new ways of communicating with others throughout the entire world as well as right next door , and new ways of improving their community and enriching their lives . 
a key objective of our economic agenda must be to ease the uncertainty of those Canadians who need to adjust to the changing economy and , at the same time , to help every Canadian take advantage of emerging opportunities and realize their full potential . 
we have a solid foundation to build on . 
we are , as we often repeat , according to the United Nations development index , the best country in the world in which to live . 
with the help of all Canadians our economic fundamentals are now the best they have been in 35 years . 
our focus now must be to construct real opportunities on the foundations already laid . 
we are already positioned to be a world leader in the global knowledge economy of the 21 st century . 
we have the people , we have the resources , we have the technology and we have the infrastructure . 
but having such assets is not enough . 
we have to mobilize our resources toward a clear objective of being the best . 
looking ahead to the millennium , we have an opportunity to explore new horizons , set new goals for our country and work together to reach those goals . 
our goal is to make Canada the most connected country in the world , making sure that all Canadians can have access to the electronic highway and information economy by the year 2000 . 
this is perhaps the single most important action that government can take to ensure success in the knowledge based economy . 
through a national strategy designed to provide access to the information and knowledge infrastructure we can enable individuals , rural communities , aboriginal communities , small and large businesses alike to find new opportunities for learning , interacting , transacting and developing their economic and social potential . 
by connecting rural and remote communities through public access sites across Canada , we are giving these communities the tools to help further their economic and social development and make the most of their existing resources to tap new markets and create new job opportunities for their citizens . 
by connecting all of Canada ' s 22,000 schools , libraries and learning institutions , we will make life - long learning an affordable reality for Canadians while Canada becomes a laboratory for the creation of interactive , multimedia learning software and networks . 
by creating the best environment for electronic commerce , Canada can become a world leader in this emerging field , leading to increased investment in electronic networks and growth in areas such as electronic transactions , multimedia products and on - line services . 
by connecting Canadians to the information highway , we will create a demand for digital content , which could strengthen Canada ' s cultural identity and create new economic opportunities . 
by putting government services on - line , we can facilitate communications between government and the people like never before . 
government services will be available to Canadians wherever they are 24 hours a day , seven days a week . 
by connecting Canadians to each other , to their institutions and governments and to the rest of the world , we will all better understand who we are and Canadians will have the tools they need to maximize their potential . 
these are only some of the many advantages we will enjoy when we link up with the new economy . 
the second theme is realizing our international potential . 
increasingly our prosperity is dependent on making the most of our international opportunities . 
one in three Canadian jobs depends on trade and every $ 1 billion increase in exports generates 8,000 new jobs . 
with team Canada we have improved our trade and investment performance but there is still much more that we must do to secure Canada ' s place in the global economy . 
building on the team Canada success , we will consult with our industrial partners to further broaden our trading base outward in the world . 
we are already extending our team Canada approach to help Canadian businesses prepare at home to compete and win in international markets . 
through Investment Partnerships Canada , we are working with industry on a focused marketing campaign in priority markets to attract investment to Canada by multinational firms because investment equal jobs . 
the third theme is investing in innovation and knowledge . 
last year 12 of Canada ' s top thinkers on science and technology were appointed to the Prime Minister ' s Advisory Council on Science and Technology . 
part of their advice was : 
a high level of investment , excellence in education , accelerated innovation through science and technology and an increased emphasis on the commercialization of science and technology , will spur job creation and generate increases in the standard of living for Canadians . 
we are taking this advice to heart . 
we must promote those knowledge intensive sectors where we are already strong , where the opportunity for growth and global leadership is highest , and where the opportunities for young Canadians are the greatest . 
canada has winning sectors , sectors on which we can build and grow to world leadership , for example , aerospace , environmental technologies , biotechnology and telecommunications and information technologies . 
together with industry we will set goals and targets to improve Canada ' s global ranking in these and other sectors . 
we also believe there is enormous growth potential for traditional sectors such as forestry , mining and agriculture to innovate and adapt information technology and biotechnology to improve productivity , to reach new markets and to develop new products . 
by investing in Canada ' s research facilities and government and university laboratories we will maintain one of the best research and development infrastructures in the world . 
we will also improve and expand the knowledge base that individuals and businesses need in order to succeed . 
we will see our $ 800 million investment in the Canada foundation for innovation used to leverage additional private and public sector investments to renew and expand the research infrastructure at Canadian universities and teaching hospitals . 
last year the government established technology partnerships Canada to make fully repayable investments in innovative firms that are developing leading edge knowledge based technologies . 
we need to continue to use the leverage of this successful program to ensure that more products with high growth potential in key sectors reach the world marketplace . 
we will build on the National Research Council ' s highly respected industrial research assistance program , winner of the prestigious Ernest C . Manning award , to help small and medium size businesses to develop and commercialize new technologies . 
we will increase the participation of Canadians in the new economy . 
supporting innovative companies and building knowledge infrastucture is not enough in itself . 
true competitive advantage in the knowledge economy is achieved only through developing the brains and skills of our people . 
the transition to the new economy is not automatic . 
some Canadians will be better prepared than others to take advantage of these opportunities , and some Canadians will need help to rise to the challenges . 
the government is committed to making a difference so that all Canadians can participate fully in and benefit from the new economy . 
the Canada millennium endowment fund will invest in academic excellence and will provide thousands of scholarships each year to help give Canadians access to universities and colleges . 
we will also develop new programs to help young Canadians acquire the experience and marketable skills to take advantage of the opportunities in today ' s job market . 
we will focus aboriginal business investment programs on more long term strategic investment opportunities for all aboriginal peoples . 
this will help to develop and strong and resilient economic base and foster partnerships among federal , provincial and aboriginal governments and the private sector . 
we will help rural communities diversify their economies and capitalize on new business opportunities by supporting their efforts to identify and build on their strengths to acquire and use new technology and to strengthen small and medium size businesses to create new jobs for rural Canadians . 
canada will prosper in the global knowledge based economy . 
we will have the opportunity to enrich our lives , create jobs , promote prosperity and ensure a future for our children . 
if we look toward the future , we see a Canada in which the harsh reality of economic change gives way to new opportunities , a Canada where jobs and growth support a stronger society , a stronger nation . 
we see Canadians connected to other Canadians . 
we see a Canada where more and more Canadians can maximize their potential and realize their dreams . 
whether they live in rural Canada , in a city , on the east coast , on the west coast or anywhere in between , Canadians deserve a government that is innovative , ready to lead and ready to advance new efforts to secure their future in a new economy . 
by connecting Canadians , by realizing our international potential , by investing in innovation and knowledge , and by increasing the participation of Canadians in the new economy we are acting to turn the promise of a new century into new opportunity for all Canadians . 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I was interested in listening to the minister as he was speaking about advantages and the various things that the government is trying to bring into play . 
with his ministry being responsible for the CRTC , I find it somewhat incongruous that he would be speaking this way . 
many of the people who try to bring new technology to the area of communications are thwarted time and time again by the CRTC . 
the minister will know that there are a number of cases which are before the courts , some of which have been appealed directly to cabinet . 
he will also know , as industry minister in the last Parliament , that during the time that cabinet sat there were probably in the neighbourhood of half a dozen serious decisions involving the CRTC which cabinet looked at , many of which were overturned . 
what is his government going to do ? 
what is he going to do ? 
better yet , the CRTC should be completely revised from the bottom up so that we can get on with the business of building Canada as it should be built , as the technological centre that it could be in the world . 
hon. John Manley : 
Mr. Speaker , there is a broad range of issues in the question on which we could have quite a long discussion . 
let me say first that I do not share the hon. member ' s pessimism about the state of the CRTC as it currently exists . 
in fact , we are a party to the World Trade Organization ' s recent agreement on telecommunications . 
i will advise the member that there will be a bill coming to the House shortly to implement our obligations under the WTO with respect to the telecommunications agreement . 
perhaps we can have some good debate at that time on some of these issues . 
the CRTC , as an independent body with a transparent process , separate from the political process , is a model which we could only wish all of our trading partners had fully implemented . 
he will know that many Canadian companies find themselves thwarted in their attempts to obtain licensing in other countries by a process which is neither transparent nor subject to any appeal or judicial review . 
the member will know that I have participated in giving direction to the CRTC in certain cases and in changing its decisions where I had the jurisdiction to do so . 
in Canada it is still a better process than that which exists , I would say , in virtually every other developed country . 
i am not quite as pessimistic as he . 
second , we have certainly experienced quite a few difficulties over a period of time . 
we will always have unhappy participants before the CRTC because somebody wins and somebody loses . 
i suggest to him that really key to the process is that we have a system in which the decisions are made by an independent body whose decisions are subject to judicial review and policy appeal to cabinet . 
it is not done behind closed doors by politicians , and I think that is a desirable way to adjudicate these issues . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , through you I would like to point out right off that the Minister of Industry recently aroused my sympathy and that of a number of my colleagues when he said the monarchy should be abolished . 
i congratulate him because he was involved in the same struggle as that fought by our forebears . 
he expressed his pride in being a member of the Canadian people . 
we support his cause . 
i would ask him to arouse our sympathy a little more . 
i have two questions for him . 
the Quebec people therefore have the right to be free of the tutelage of a majority that is not of its own . 
the Hon. John Manley : 
Mr. Speaker , I must say to the hon. member that , as industry minister , I had the opportunity to travel around the world ; I have seen for myself that , as far as the quality of products , services or technology is concerned , Canadian entrepreneurs and businesses are recognized all over the world . 
i do not understand why a country like Canada which has benefited so much from its diversity of cultures and languages would even discuss a change which could weaken the partners of a country that is such a global success story . 
i will add that , in the areas we are trying to help , that is to say international trade and technology , a third company like Bombardier would benefit Quebec far more than a third referendum . 
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the minister ' s outline this morning on the strength of our economy and the position that we are in to take full advantage of the opportunities of the future . 
however , I think he embellishes the picture . 
shining through all of this is the fact that 50 cents of every dollar that Canadians earn goes to taxes in one form or another . 
this perhaps has contributed to the fact that the report is that one child in every five is living in poverty , that we have an aboriginal lady who has to live in a van in Alberta on one of the richest reserves in Canada . 
could the minister comment with regard to his glowing picture of the position that our economy is in and our society is in with regard to these particular issues ? 
there are other issues but I see I do not have time to touch on them . 
could the minister address those two issues , the rate of child poverty in this country and the fact that we have aboriginal people living in worse than third world conditions ? 
hon. John Manley : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member puts his finger on two of the big problems that we have to address in Canada . 
no one would seek to describe a picture in which everything is perfect or all the work is done . 
i think that in relative terms compared to anywhere else in the world , where would the hon. member prefer to live ? 
where are the problems more manageable than they are in Canada at a time when we have our economic fundamentals finally improved to the point of being the best in 35 years ? 
i would not disagree with him that the mountain of debt which was accumulated over 20 years is one of the causes of the problems that he has identified . 
it is changing for Canada and for all other nations of the world . 
we are positioned to not only succeed but to succeed beyond the possibility for anybody else to succeed . 
let us seize that opportunity . 
it will undoubtedly hold the key to reducing child poverty and aboriginal isolation in Canada . 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I intend to share my time with my colleague , the hon. member for Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac . 
Mr. Speaker , in congratulating you and the other Speakers , I want to thank first the voters of Palliser for the confidence that they extended to me on June 2 . 
without offending the Bloc members , it was a unique experience to enter the House of Commons for the first time a week ago today . 
it is an honour not only to represent them but also to work hard on their behalf over the life of this 36 th Parliament . 
to the members on the opposite side I would like to take a few minutes to explain the riding of Palliser , which is in south central Saskatchewan . Palliser is a riding that is centred around the city of Moose Jaw and includes small towns , farm lands , ranches as well as the southwest quadrant of Regina . 
if there was ever a riding that the Liberal Party should have won on June 2 in the province of Saskatchewan , surely it was the riding of Palliser . 
since the Saskatchewan voters are at least as sophisticated as those in the rest of the country , I want to take a few minutes to explain why it did not win in Palliser . 
some of the answers are contained in what is and is not in the throne speech of last Tuesday . 
there is for example nothing on national transportation and only the barest of references to agriculture . 
on social policies there is a very thin veneer but almost without any substance to it . 
this is particularly surprising especially because the government has 65 percent of its members from one province . 
i would have thought the government would have recognized this deficiency and have begun to address it in the initial throne speech but that was not to be . 
the government quickly needs to get out of the Quebec City to Windsor corridor so it can hear from the people in the rest of the country and begin to address their concerns . 
the one item that intrigues me about the Speech from the Throne was the fact that 130 years ago the leaders of this country saw the necessity of a national transportation link . 
the fact that transportation was entirely ignored in the throne speech would indicate to me that instead of preparing for the 21 st century the Liberals aren ' t even up to speed with 19 th century leaders . 
we see this through the dismantling of so much of our transportation system , whether it is the privatization of air and sea ports , the privatization of the CNR , the abandoning of branch lines in western Canada or the doubling of freight rates in the post Crow era . 
there is also no commitment to a national highway system despite the fact that this government enjoys $ 5 billion per annum from gasoline taxes . 
canada is the only OECD country which does not have a national highway system . 
that makes it harder for our companies and our workers to compete in the global market . 
Saskatchewan as everybody knows is a landlocked province and good transportation is absolutely essential to move our products to port , to create and retain satisfied customers and to feed a hungry world . 
i would have thought that in all the talk about partnerships in last week ' s throne speech , this is one way to work with the provinces and territories to develop a true national transportation policy . 
on the subject of agriculture , it is one of Canada ' s best export earners . 
here again a national strategy is required . 
we need to build for the future through trade expansion and value added products . 
at the same time we note that R and D in agriculture has been cut by billions of dollars in recent years . 
i do want to sincerely extend best wishes to the new minister of agriculture who was here a little bit earlier and his elevation to cabinet . 
our hope is that he will work with the opposition parties to help farmers and rural Canadians across the country . 
on a personal note may I say that I know the area of the country that the minister comes from and I am sure he will be conscientious of working with all of us . 
let me turn quickly to the social safety net and particularly the subject of intergenerational transfers and what it has meant in the past to be a Canadian . 
it was an unwritten agreement which stated " as a young person let me pay a reasonable tuition fee and I will help you in your retirement '' . 
certainly that was there when I was at university but now the social safety net is being torn apart . 
it began under the Tories and has been continued by the Liberals . 
the result is that tuition fees are going through the roof and nobody in their right mind is going to come out of university with a $ 35,000 or $ 40,000 bill for his or her education and say " Sure , I will pay that off and then I will be glad to help you with your pension '' . 
successive governments have tinkered and cut social programs under the rubric of a user pay mentality with the result that they are breaking social contracts between generations . 
we can all cite examples , the CHST , employment insurance , CPP , and that contradiction in terms called the seniors benefit . 
we are going backwards in our quest for social justice and fairness . 
this regression is aided and abetted by the false start program of the Reform Party . 
last week there were lots of tributes paid to Stanley Knowles , the late member of Parliament for Winnipeg North Centre . 
if Stanley had been around he would probably have had another arrowroot biscuit and a cup of tea in quiet celebration of the fact . 
we could honour his memory better by introducing progressive changes like affordable tuition , a decent pension plan and a fair and equitable tax system . 
Stanley ' s lifelong friend Tommy Douglas said it very well a number of years ago , " The measure of a nation ' s greatness does not lie in its conquests , its GNP , its gold reserves or its skyscrapers . 
the real measure is what it does for the least fortunate and the opportunities it provides for its youth to lead useful and meaningful lives '' . 
i would say to the government House leader and the government , do not frustrate but rather ensure that standing and select committees have sufficient powers and are vested with sufficient authority to carry out the work ahead . 
we have five recognized parties in the House and that means we require a mature and modern approach to deal with it . 
it is the first time that we have ever had five parties . 
if the government follows that advice , it will be very good for this 36 th Parliament , it will be good for Canadians and it will be good for the future of parliamentary democracy . 
that the amendment be modified by adding after the words " legislative program that '' , the following : " in failing to set targets and timetables to reduce unemployment and in failing to strengthen national programs such as medicare which promote the equality of all Canadians and the unity of the country is an affront to fundamental Canadian values '' . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the amendment moved by the hon. member for Palliser will be checked by the table officers . 
we will resume with questions and comments . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to know if the New Democratic Party agrees that this government should send a team Canada group into the Atlantic region so that there will be a better understanding of the needs of our people in the Atlantic region , and find a way to create the jobs for all those mature people who are out of work , the moms and dads who want to work , who want to feed their families and pay for the education of their children and get back their dignity . 
i would like to know if they agree with that . 
Mr. Dick Proctor : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not think this caucus would oppose that in any way . 
i would also want to acknowledge the fact that the people from that region sent a number of opposition members , including eight from this caucus , to Ottawa to voice their concerns about what was not happening in that part of the world . 
i appreciate that there is a reasonable delegation from the member ' s party also . 
the point that I was trying to make at the outset was that I would hope this government would be listening to people who live beyond the Quebec City - Windsor corridor and reaching out so that we can move this country ahead into the 21 st century . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the industry minister chose earlier not to answer a question a Bloc Quebecois member was asking him . 
the hon. member was asking whether or not the House recognizes the existence of a Quebec people ; given the importance of that question , I will turn to the NDP member and ask him if , as a representative of the New Democratic Party , he can give us an answer . 
does his Party recognize the existence of a Quebec people ? 
i would really like him to give us a clear answer because this question is closely linked to the Speech from the Throne , when it comes to national unity and the unique character of Quebec society . 
we in Quebec believe this is not enough . 
even some federalist Liberal organizers say it is an empty shell . 
i would like to know in no uncertain terms whether or not the member from the New Democratic Party recognizes the existence of a Quebec people . 
Mr. Dick Proctor : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the question that the hon. member from the Bloc is asking was in effect answered by this House and this caucus on Thursday last when we voted against the Bloc amendment . 
there is really no need for us to delve into that further at this time . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the amendment moved by the hon. member for Palliser is in order . 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to take part in this debate . 
i want to talk a bit about the throne speech and what was in it for the people of Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac . 
maybe some time we should stop and think about how they live . 
many of my friends on social assistance do not know what it is to have gifts under the tree at Christmastime . 
many of us here have never been in that situation . 
some know what it is like not to wonder if they will be able to feed their children or be able to pay the $ 100 registration fee for a six year old to join hockey . 
some know what it is like to live in shelters for battered women . 
there are many of us out there and no facilities to accommodate the need . 
some know what impact sun and rain has on tourism in the Atlantic . 
does everyone understand the impact a rainy summer on the Atlantic region when the tourists do not come ? 
not only does it affect workers . 
it also affects businesses . 
i am one who knows the impact of government cuts on small and medium size business . 
when people do not have money to spend businesses do not sell . 
i am one who knows what it is to be a seasonal worker . 
i am proud to stand before the House on behalf of the people of Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac and on behalf of seasonal workers . 
seasonal work is important in Atlantic Canada but misunderstood by the Liberal government . 
seasonal workers have been called every name in the book by the Liberal government , from being dependent on the UI system to being lazy and drunk in taverns and not wanting to look for work . 
this is from the ex MP for Beaus é jour , the prime minister himself . 
it is interesting when we think about it that they are the same so - called lazy people he so proudly came to beg for support to get his one way ticket to Ottawa . 
i take part of the blame for his being prime minister ; the people of Beaus é jour elected him and gave him that opportunity . 
members may be wondering today what the riding of Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac got from the Prime Minister in return for electing someone who is not from the area . 
it gives me great pleasure to tell you all about it . 
first , we got cuts in health care , which have resulted in an unacceptable situation for our seniors . 
we all heard about the two employees who spoke up against the unacceptable situation in nursing homes caused by the cuts in transfer payments to the provinces . 
i must denounce the disciplinary measures taken by the management of the Providence home in Shediac against two employees who tried to pressure the federal and provincial ministers into putting more money in health care so that they could properly care for our seniors . 
these are the people who fought for our country during the Second World War . 
the present government shows absolutely no respect for our senior citizens . 
we also saw cuts in unemployment insurance , now called employment insurance , a name I do not agree with at all . 
even though the Prime Minister had promised during the 1991 election campaign to shorten the qualifying period , today we find ourselves with a system that no longer meets the needs of the unemployed . 
people call us in our riding offices crying and saying their employment insurance benefits have run out and their seasonal work is not due to start for another two or three months . 
there are also people who do not qualify at all for employment insurance , such as part time workers in hospitals , schools , plants , and so on . 
they even closed employment centres like the one in Bouctouche . 
instead of helping rural communities overcome the lack of jobs , the federal government is taking away from the unemployed the necessary tools that could help them rejoin the labour market . 
they also cut the staff of other employment centres , like the ones in Shediac , Sackville and Richibuctou , at a time when there is a surplus in the employment insurance fund . 
we must start trying to understand the situation in which rural communities find themselves . 
in our region , jobs are not found on every street corner . 
let us see what Sackville received from the Liberals . 
we no longer have an animal pathology lab . 
approximately 60 employees lost their jobs at Maritime Atlantic . 
the armouries is on the way out . 
after going door to door during the campaign I call Albert County the forgotten land . 
it has been absolutely ignored in every way imaginable . 
we must not forget jobs , jobs , jobs . 
in New Brunswick we are getting job creation at $ 6.25 an hour . 
has anyone calculated how much money a person makes at $ 6.25 an hour for 35 hours a week and how much that person is paying for child care ? 
i have talked to those people . 
i have had single mothers around me crying because they just do not work . 
the $ 6.25 an hour jobs are for a maximum of 26 weeks so they can go back on EI . 
now the Liberals are wondering why there are so many poor families . 
as I look across the floor I can see who is responsible for the increase in poverty . 
it is the Liberal government . 
while it caters to the bank , families are suffering . 
this is not acceptable . 
liberals should be ashamed . 
they should be setting targets for the reduction of unemployment just as they have set targets for deficit reduction . 
we have the HST instead . 
we now pay 15 per cent tax on children ' s clothing , electricity , heating , and it goes on and on . 
again it attacks low income families . 
when will it stop ? 
the young people graduating from high school have lost all hope in post - secondary education . 
all the cuts came with an extremely high price . 
people are losing their jobs . 
families cannot take that stress any longer . 
the failures of past and present government policies have driven them to complete despair and destroyed their proud and historical way of life . 
the throne speech mentioned a deep concern for aboriginal issues . 
if the government were so concerned about the first nations , why is the Big Cove Reserve suicide situation not recognized as a crisis ? 
two more young first nations people have died over the last three months since the help line was cut due to insufficient funding . 
unfortunately there was nothing in the throne speech to give hope to the elderly , the students , the sick , the unemployed and the small and medium businesses of Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac . 
let us not forget we got one thing : we got a senator . 
i thank the people of Beaus é jour for paying off the deficit and all the other unemployed , sick and students of the country who paid the deficit . 
if members do not believe me they can ask the banks . 
in closing , if a mother starves her child it is called child abuse , but if the Liberals starve a million children it is called balancing the books . 
the pain has to stop . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
i met the member for Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac a few years back , when the Standing Committee on Finance was travelling across the country . 
she always represented the most disadvantaged members of society with dignity and in her speech today she is once again standing up for those who do not have a voice in this Parliament . 
my question for the member for Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac is not about her undeniable social commitment , but about the existence of a Quebec people in Canada . 
does the member for Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac share the point of view of her colleague , who just replied that the New Democratic Party had voted against the amendment proposed by the Bloc Quebecois - that the existence of the people of Quebec be recognized - and that it had nothing else to say , given the vote ? 
does the member for Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , in her great wisdom and as an Acadian representative , share her colleague ' s opinion , or does she recognize the existence of a Quebec people ? 
Ms. Angela Vautour : 
Mr. Speaker , it is true that we voted against the motion because we have a great belief in national programs . 
but we most certainly recognize Quebec as a unique people . 
you have your language and culture , in your country , as do we Acadians . 
but that does not mean that we want to drop our national programs . 
that is why I believe strongly that we should keep our country together . 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I also add my congratulations to the NDP member on her first speech . 
i have a very short and succinct question to ask . 
she mentioned in her speech the little phrase " paying off the deficit '' . 
that is a total misnomer . 
there is no such thing as paying off the deficit . 
the deficit is an amount of money that one borrows . 
at best one can reduce the amount that one is borrowing . 
the increased spending promoted by the member , and I presume her party , would require additional borrowing . 
thereby more and more taxpayers ' dollars would be sent to the financial organizations of the world instead of financing and paying for needed social programs . 
there is a tremendous contradiction in the NDP platform . 
the more borrowed money we spend on social programs , in the long run the more money we send to financial institutions and deprive it from being available for social programs . 
Ms. Angela Vautour : 
did any banks pay on that deficit ? 
did any of the very wealthy pay on that deficit ? 
he should check with the people who cannot feed their children any more . 
what the hon. member should understand is who is suffering today because of deficit reduction . 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I reiterate that we have not paid off the deficit because that is a physical impossibility . 
the deficit is the amount of money which is being borrowed . 
the member is confusing it with the reference to debt . 
the fact is as long as there is any deficit the debt will increase . 
Ms. Angela Vautour : 
Mr. Speaker , try to explain that to a mother who cannot feed her children or to the person who just lost his or her job . 
believe me , at this point no one is worried about that . 
what I am worried about - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time allotment this morning with the hon. member for Oxford . 
i rise to address my colleagues in the highest forum in our country and in so doing I acknowledge with considerable humility the great honour and privilege which has been bestowed on me by the people of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford . 
as the Prime Minister pointed out in his speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne , this Parliament will be the last one of this century and the first one of the new millennium . 
as such , the opportunity to participate in this Parliament is an historic occasion . 
i will spare no effort to meet the challenges it will present . 
i am here today by the grace of God , by the support of my husband and family , and the commitment and hard work of many volunteers and friends . 
i am most grateful to them , as I am to all the citizens of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford for their trust and their support . 
my riding is balanced , with the city of Barrie to the north , Bradford West Gwillimburyberry to the south and the towns and farms of Innisfil in between . 
the northern portion of Barrie and Innisfil have not sent a Liberal member to Parliament since Duncan F . McCuaig , the father of our current mayor in Barrie , Janice Laking . 
he represented the riding from 1935 to 1945 . 
it is an honour and a great privilege to bring this part of Ontario back to the Liberal fold after some 52 years . 
the city of Barrie is an exciting phenomena of explosive growth , combined with a superb geographical location that affords its citizens an enviable quality of life . 
it is situated on the shores of Lake Simcoe and enjoys all the amenities that top recreational facilities and dynamic economic growth provide . 
indeed , one of the country ' s fastest growing cities , Barrie will double its population by the year 2001 , largely due to many of Toronto ' s immigrant families moving north . 
the workforce in Barrie is well educated , highly skilled and diversified . 
the city has a strong automotive manufacturing sector , plastics manufacturing and a strong industrial automation sector . 
the city is well represented internationally by companies like Albarrie , Yachiyo , Canplas and Alloy Wheels . 
Bradford West Gwillimbury in the south of my riding has a population of 17,000 and has outpaced Barrie in developing a strong , multicultural mosaic . 
the municipality is home to 450 businesses and is impacted greatly by the Holland Marsh , the heart of Canada ' s vegetable industry , the salad bowl of Ontario . 
over 90 percent of the produce of the Marsh is processed and packaged in Bradford West Gwillimbury where the agri - industry is a major contributor to the local economy . 
the town of Innisfil is a mixed urban - rural community in south Simcoe . 
last year the celebration of Yonge Street as 200 years old held special significance for Innisfil as much of its history was impacted by the development of what was known as Penetanguishene Road and later Yonge Street . 
this was the route used by the settlers who came from Europe to clear the land and develop their farms . 
today Innisfil has a population of 26,000 with many skilled workers who commute to nearby urban centres and many who work in the industrial manufacturing sector of the municipality . 
it is then with great pride that I come to Ottawa to represent this diverse yet typically Canadian part of Ontario . 
the citizens of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford supported my election to the House of Commons because they strongly endorsed the government ' s track record on reducing the deficit and moving the country into the requisite of fiscal responsibility . 
everywhere I went during the June election I was told that the pain had been real but worthwhile since the strategy of achieving a balanced budget had been successful . 
this was what my constituents had accepted as a very real priority . 
i was told by many that to fail to continue along the road to debt reduction following the elimination of the deficit would be very erroneous indeed . 
the businesses in my riding count heavily on the government to stay the course and provide the stability that allows for reinvestment in the economy that will contribute in the long run to the long term creation of jobs . 
while I agree with that plan , I also believe it is very much incumbent on business , large and small , to partner with us in the creation of these jobs by providing internships , providing youth with the skills and mentoring that gives them the experience and life skills to help them obtain gainful employment . 
youth and adult unemployment are not the responsibility of governments alone . 
they are the responsibility as well of business and industry that are able to grow and prosper in an economy turned around by the courage of this Liberal government . 
the people of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford also believe that the reinforcement of our social programs is a major goal for the government and it is one that I heartily endorse . 
the delivery of the Canada Health Act is vital . 
addressing the causes and cures of child poverty are also vital . 
the willingness and flexibility to work with the provincial governments as our partners to achieve these goals is very much a part of the government ' s approach . 
to reconcile the dilemma that the continued support in Quebec for sovereignty , however diminished as the polls suggest , is a personal goal and one that contributed greatly to my decision to run for Parliament . 
as a new member of Parliament , the walls of my office are bare except for one framed poster I brought with me . 
the poster reads " If you want peace , work for justice '' - `` si on veut la paix , il faut travailler pour la justice '' . 
it is an activist slogan but then we are all activists or we would not be here . 
indeed we want peace , the peace that results from a resolution to the current dilemma that some Quebecois are unconvinced that their future is best realized within the framework of the Canadian Confederation . 
the road to that peace is through justice . 
we must determine what is a just sharing of powers , what is a just treatment of a unique culture and unique province within the constitutional framework , what is a just guarantee of minority rights within the part and within the whole . 
it is my firm belief that we are capable of giving , of taking risks , of finding the just solution . 
i am not naive ; I know we still have a ways to go . 
but it is very important to remember that the principles of social justice have long been a part of the Liberal Party ' s philosophy . 
that is why the majority of Canadians chose a Liberal government and that is why I am a member of that government . 
the concept of social justice is what gives Canada its reputation for compassion and tolerance . 
it is partly why we are considered the very best country in the world today . 
do not forget , my friends from Quebec , that as a Canadian I share your history and your dreams , and that I will share your future . 
i will do everything in my power to see that we share this future together . 
i came to Parliament to help keep this country together . 
i look forward with great anticipation to the challenges and victories we will achieve in this , the 36 th Parliament . 
i have a sense that the goals we all share will move us forward in our common quest for the betterment of Canada . 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , congratulations on your appointment as deputy chairman of the committees of the whole House . 
i am also taking this opportunity to thank the voters of West Nova for asking me to look after their interests - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Mark Muise : 
more recently , in an interview with the daily Le Droit , the Bloc Quebecois critic on official languages said that the Bloc would always defend francophones outside Quebec . 
this is why I am very surprised by the events that took place in recent days . 
i am surprised that the Bloc Quebecois did not make mention of its support for francophone and Acadian communities in its action plan for the year 2000 , which was tabled last week - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
would the hon. member put the question to the member on questions and comments . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since this is questions and comments , I will refer to the remarks made by the member for Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford . 
as we know , the Ontario premier , Mr. Harris , said shortly after the Calgary declaration that Quebec was just as unique as Pacific salmon is . 
the hon. member claims to be in politics for the purpose , among others , of saving this great country . 
this is fine rhetoric , but nothing concrete is ever done . 
still , Quebecers are patient as they approach the new millennium . 
this is very short . 
aboriginal peoples are recognized . 
so , as a government member , will the hon. member tell us whether Quebecers are a people , yes or no ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the Chair apologizes to the hon. member for Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford . 
i should have gone back to the hon. member after the comment made by the member for West Nova . 
Ms. Aileen Carroll : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the question from my friend on the opposite side of the House . 
i listened carefully and found it a little meandering . 
i hope to conclude that I do not have to defend people , other than the government , in their views . 
although Mr. Harris may have made that comment I have not heard it . 
i believe that Mr. Harris has participated in Calgary with other premiers who have moved forward in their attempts to achieve the just resolution which I spoke of earlier in recognizing a uniqueness in the province of Quebec and a uniqueness in its society . 
they have been joined by our government in moving forward . 
i have great optimism and I believe there has been a variety of versions of history frequently dependent on the author . 
we have to reach across those perhaps slanted views . 
it is difficult today to get across the media of each language and speak with one another , but we have this forum to come together and resolve perhaps what has not yet been resolved . 
in this Parliament over the next few years we will resolve it . 
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate you on your appointment as one of our deputy speakers and I wish you well . 
i would also like to thank my colleague from Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford for sharing her time this morning and I would like to thank my constituents for re - electing me to serve another term in the 36 th Parliament . 
in 1929 I was born in the Dominican Republic to British parents . 
after a short return to England my parents emigrated with our small family to Canada . 
like millions of other immigrants who have built our great country , my parents came to Canada in search of a better life for themselves and their children . 
they watched as my brother became a successful lawyer in Vancouver , while I spent my career in education in Oxford Country , retired and was first elected to the House in 1993 . 
it is difficult to put into words my feelings as I was recently sworn in , for the second time , as a member of this esteemed Chamber . 
in addition to constituents , present at the ceremony was my father , age 94 , who resides in a retirement home here in Ottawa . 
no matter how old we get we each want to gain the approval of our parents . 
my presence here as the member of Parliament for Oxford is an incredible honour for me but it has made my father , who came to this country so many years before with a wife an two young sons in tow , a very proud man . 
family ties are precious things , whether it be in our families at home where parents and children work together for the common good or in our Canadian family . 
i think this is a goal of most of here in the House on both sides . 
while we may disagree on the process we all want to effect change that will improve the lives of all Canadians . 
in my first term as the member of Parliament for Oxford I asked myself what I could do to assist in unifying our nation . 
to me one of our biggest problems is a lack of understanding between various regions of our country . 
in other words , it seems that the " two solitudes " of Hugh McLellen are still evident . 
i am happy to say that after two summer exchanges with the assistance of the Canada employment centres in both ridings , VIA Rail and Heritage Canada , this project can be termed a success . 
in fact , the member for Brome - Missisquoi took the initiative to organize exchanges between ridings from across Canada and towns and villages in his riding . 
students from all regions of the country were able to visit Quebec , while Quebec students were able to increase their awareness of Canada outside Quebec . 
this past summer the Department of Canadian Heritage was more heavily involved and over 200 students were able to take part in similar exchanges between Quebec and the rest of the country . 
it is my hope that young Canadians will be able to benefit from this type of program for many years to come . 
will this program alone solve our unity problems ? 
no , it will not , but it can increase the understanding Canadians have for each other and work together with other initiatives at local , provincial and national levels to keep our country united . 
as the throne speech stated , we would all be forever diminished , forever changed , should we fail to maintain the example Canada provides to the world . 
our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding . 
it is a relief also to hear that the people of Quebec have shown in most recent polls they would rather accept the declaration worked out in Calgary than separate . 
it is now incumbent on us to work together as a Canadian family to build a better and stronger Canada for our children . 
we have , of course , seen the Liberal government take firm action to ensure that the federal government spends within its means . 
sound economic management and the best federal finance minister in Canadian history are restoring balance to the nation ' s finances . 
in the very near future the government of Canada will not have to deal with a crushing deficit . 
with a common sense of purpose we as legislators can begin the process of paying off the national debt while making strategic investments in our children and our youth , our health , our communities and our knowledge and creativity . 
we must ensure that all Canadians can benefit from this economic success . 
we must not leave anyone behind . 
this government must give all Canadians access to the tools of economic growth , as the Minister of Industry said earlier this morning in the House . 
we cannot allow rural regions of the country to suffer from a lack of technology while urban regions prosper . 
as the member of Parliament for a rural country in southwestern Ontario , I have told my constituents that I will strive to ensure that the rural way of life is protected and that they will continue to have access to the tools they need to be competitive in this global economy . 
the community access program , CAP , is connecting rural areas in this country to the information superhighway . 
by putting Internet access points in rural communities we are giving rural citizens the same opportunities to access information and resources that urban Canadians enjoy . 
we are also giving our students in places like Knowlton , Otterville or Cambridge Bay the same advantages provided by the computer age as students who may be studying in Toronto , Montreal or Vancouver . 
the people of Oxford are taking full advantage of the CAP program . 
when Industry Canada made its first round of approvals for this program , 15 of the 271 winning bids across Canada were in Oxford County . 
to understand the magnitude of this we must consider that the approvals within Oxford represented nearly 25 percent of the total approvals within the province of Ontario . 
this success is a testament to the commitment of Oxford ' s citizens to take advantage of the programs that can benefit them as we prepare to enter the new millennium . 
i have also pledged to my constituents that I will fight for a strong , influential department of agriculture . 
Canadian farmers need to know that their interests are being considered when decisions are being made by the federal government . 
i am confident that our new minister of agriculture from Ontario will serve Canadian agriculture with the same level of distinction as did his predecessor . 
Oxford County has been my home for over 40 years . 
it is where I worked as a teacher , principal and superintendent of education . 
it is where I helped raise a family and where my heart is . 
you cannot visit Oxford without being struck by the beauty of its farmland and the generous hospitality of its citizens . 
when I was re - elected this past June 2 , I was mindful of the responsibility that the people of Oxford had once again given me . 
each day I serve on Parliament Hill and in this magnificent Chamber I seek to ensure that their voices are heard , that their views are known and that their values are represented . 
the people of Oxford have sent me here as their representative , a responsibility I do not take lightly . 
i will do my best to ensure their trust in me has been well placed . 
our work in this place over the next four years will be difficult . 
at times tempers will flare but we must always remember that together we are representatives of the Canadian family . 
Canadians , regardless of their political persuasion , want us to work constructively and co - operatively to solve the problems of our nation . 
let us get on with the business at hand so that we can enter the 21 st century confident and united . 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have listened with great interest to my colleague , the hon. member for Oxford . 
most of his speech was about the Calgary proposal and national unity . 
members will recall that , when Canadians and Quebecers were asked to vote on the Charlottetown accord in 1992 , Quebecers rejected the accord as clearly not enough , while the rest of Canada rejected it because , in their estimation , it was giving far too much to the people of Quebec . 
just this morning , it was reported in Le Journal de Montr é al , Le Journal de Qu é bec and The Globe and Mail that a poll by L é ger & L é ger indicated that 45 percent of Quebecers said the Calgary proposal was clearly not enough , while another 35 percent could live with it . 
also , this morning ' s press summary shows that there are already people in English Canada who are openly saying that too much is being offered in the Calgary proposal . 
how can an agreement , which I feel is impossible , ever be reached ? 
again this past weekend - and I will conclude on that - former Liberal Party leader Claude Ryan raised serious doubts . 
Andr é Tremblay , who was former premier Bourassa ' s adviser for several years , said there was too little in there to say it was not enough . 
there is also Senator Rivest , who was also an adviser to Robert Bourassa , who said that the Quebec Liberal Party should distance itself from its friends in the Liberal Party of Canada . 
could the hon. member for Oxford tell us , as the representative of the views of the people of Oxford , whether his constituents feel that what was offered to Quebec in the Calgary declaration was enough or not ? 
Mr. John Finlay : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the comments and the question from my colleague from Frontenac - M é gantic whom I worked with for some years on the environment committee in the last Parliament . 
simplification and oversimplification are things we have to guard against . 
he is quite right . 
about one - third of those who would vote yes for separation thought they were equivalent , whereas 55 % of those who would vote no said they were equivalent . 
we have to continue to work toward a solution , a compromise , something that will work in this country . 
i supported it as a member of the yes committee in the last attempt in Oxford county . 
it was not overwhelmingly defeated by everyone outside Quebec . 
it was a very narrow defeat . 
people can change . 
people learn . 
people develop . 
therefore I would encourage the hon. member not to take it as the final word . 
that is what we are here to do , to work toward a solution . 
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
i would first like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your position as Acting Speaker . 
it is a great pleasure that I join in the debate on the Speech from the Throne , representing my electorate of Markham . 
i believe and I am sure many members of this House will agree that the government ' s plan is an attempt to move forward to the past . 
this government through the 29 spending proposals outlined last Tuesday is seeking to take Canada back 20 some years to the period of tax and spend Liberalism , a time of ballooning deficits , the Trudeau years , a time our current Prime Minister remembers with great fondness . 
why then is this government willing to throw away all the sacrifices made to eliminate the deficit ? 
in a free market system like Canada , the private sector has always operated under budget constraints . 
it is a fact of life , a reality that forces companies to make tough choices , choices that are both efficient and effective . 
since 1984 the federal government accepted budget constraints and in turn made tough choices , choices that have led us to the other end of the deficit tunnel . 
budget constraints force us as a nation to set priorities and find efficiencies . 
this is clearly difficult for Canadians . 
the throne speech of last week says to Canadians that the future will mean new spending , new programs and by that , sabotaging what we have been doing for over a decade . 
by telling Canadians that the federal government no longer has to make tough decisions , we risk going back to the welfare state where entrepreneurs who brought about innovation will become lobbyists in search of government goodies . 
we know that in a world of inflation , individuals find it profitable to enter financial professions that benefit from inflation rather than technological and scientific ones that promote growth . 
why then would the government encourage the practice of making new promises of dispensing taxpayers ' dollars which gives an incentive for individuals and companies to invest in seeking those dollars rather than in technological innovation ? 
for all intents and purposes we have achieved a national consensus on the need to rethink the role of government , to set priorities in support of economic growth in employment through innovation . 
the Speech from the Throne threatens this consensus and risks all that has been achieved . 
we cannot allow the government to go back to the tax and spend seventies . 
the government talks a lot about the new economy but understands little of it . 
the new economy is about innovation which in turn is dependent on a stock of highly skilled workers , workers who are as mobile as the companies in which they operate . 
how do we encourage these domestic and foreign workers to choose Canada ? 
with attributes such as low taxes , quality education and health care and a safe and clean environment . 
we do not have to research economic theory to know that broadly based rather than targeted government programs provide the bigger bang for the buck . 
this is common sense yet it escapes the thinking of the government . 
we know that taxes are too high in this country . 
while progress has been made in lowering the deficit , it has come at the expense of jobs through higher taxes . 
since 1993 this government has increased taxes no less than 40 times : 12 hikes in the 1994 budget , 11 hikes in the 1995 budget , 10 in the 1996 budget and more in the budget of this year . 
the widening tax gap between Canada and the U.S. continues to damage our standard of living . 
taxes in Canada now account for almost 40 percent of GDP . 
the outlook is not encouraging given the CPP hikes proposed by the government without corresponding cuts in EI premiums . 
to add insult to injury , the proposed CPP premiums will hit self - employed workers hardest , those workers of the new economy , yet will do nothing to address the unfounded liability facing younger generations . 
together the CPP and EI premiums will reduce , not create jobs in the country . 
the EI account is expected to reach $ 16 billion this fiscal year . 
this is far from the $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion EI surplus the Minister of Finance talked about in 1995 . 
to put this in perspective , working Canadians will have contributed over $ 110,000 to the EI surplus during the short 10 minutes it takes me to debate the Speech from the Throne . 
to justify the current surplus the Minister of Finance must be forecasting future unemployment in the 10 percent to 15 percent range , requiring a recession of immense proportion . 
the reality however is that the most pervasive tax , the tax on jobs , has less to do with being prudent and more to do with eliminating the deficit by taxing jobs directly . 
now as we approach the other end of the deficit tunnel , this government chooses to continue to forgo jobs and tax jobs at a rate of $ 2.80 per $ 100 of insurable earnings , nearly 30 % higher than necessary . 
members should ask how much more employment is this government willing to forgo . 
this mandate holds little hope for tax relief . 
furthermore only the party to which I belong is calling for immediate tax cuts . 
now unshackled by deficit , the Liberals talk of new spending while other parties speak of debt reduction before tax relief . 
we on the other hand choose to speak about priorities . 
by legislating balanced budgets , by holding the line on spending , by directing surplus to tax cuts , the debt will fall to 45 percent of GDP within 10 years as a result of the growth in the economy . 
the other parties are wrong when they say that tax cuts can only come at the expense of the debt . 
this is why the PC party is calling on the government to reward Canadians for enduring years of high taxes by reducing income taxes immediately . 
only then can we increase our competitive edge with our trading partners , notably the U.S. , having economic growth and employment growth in this country . 
the Speech from the Throne does little to promote growth in employment . 
the government pays lip service to promoting jobs for young people but its actions do not support its promises . 
i see examples of this government ' s hypocrisy every day in my riding of Markham . 
this is typical of the hypocrisy of this government . 
innovation and the economic growth that it generates is not produced by any particular program but by fostering a society that encourages innovation and change . 
government programs and government money do not do this . 
putting computers in schools and hooking them up to the Internet does not do this . 
creating economic incentives and opening up markets while eliminating regulations , monopolies and protected markets helps to foster a new economy . 
unlike the 29 proposals found in the throne speech , these are changes that do not cost the government money . 
in other words , growth - promoting economic policies can in many instances be implemented independently of the fiscal position of the government . 
the federal government however chooses to view everything in terms of revenue and expenditures . 
as we move into the next millennium , profound changes will continue to take place in the economy . 
this government had the opportunity in last week ' s Speech from the Throne to choose one of two paths : move forward to the future using the tools of tomorrow , low taxes , a government that encourages innovation and economic growth ; or move forward to the past using the tools of yesterday , high taxes , interventionist government . 
unfortunately , the government chose the latter and missed the opportunity to offer Canadians real leadership . 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as a new member to this House , my colleague from Markham , my next door neighbour , offers me an example to clearly and loudly say in this House how different our views of the world are . 
i listened very carefully as he talked about the tough choices the government had to make . 
he used as an example of his and his party ' s policy the Government of Ontario . 
i would say to him that the deep cuts to health , education and the important programs that people care about are directly a result of the commitment that the Government of Ontario made to cut personal income taxes by some 30 % before the budget was balanced . 
we know that is a similar policy to the Conservative Party as the member has just outlined . 
however , it is in stark contrast to the balanced and fiscally responsible approach of the previous Liberal government which made a commitment to first balance the budget , protect important social programs and then in a climate of fiscal prudence look at the balance between enhancement and maintenance of the programs that we value in our society and those which have made us number one in the world and a 50 % approach to using surpluses for the purposes of debt and tax relief . 
the member should note a study which was just done for the Bank of Nova Scotia , certainly not a partisan institution in this country . 
the study was done by the Boston Consulting Group . 
the study states that quality of life issues are extremely important in the greater Toronto area and metropolitan Toronto in particular to attracting jobs and growth . 
as the member sticks to the rhetoric of the campaign , and as my neighbour we share such different views , would he acknowledge that perhaps the reason his party is in fifth position is because Canadians have seen the dramatic results of irresponsible tax cuts that have taken place in Ontario and have resulted in dramatic and drastic cuts to programs which impact on the quality of life . 
Mr. Jim Jones : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the question from my colleague . 
i think we all realise we are in a very competitive world today . 
we are in the global economy and in order for us to create jobs and be competitive against the rest of the world we cannot afford to continue with high costs . 
everybody knows in this House that some of the reasons why the provinces had to make very drastic cuts in the last three or four years to health care and education are the reductions in transfer payments the federal Liberals gave to the provinces . 
also , I am not here to defend the Ontario government but the Ontario government , with its tax cuts , is creating 30,000 to 40,000 jobs a month in the last four to six months . 
it goes to prove that low taxes create jobs and high taxes cost jobs . 
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the member for Markham on his maiden speech here in the House , and I would also like to congratulate him on his victory at Markham . 
i have spoken in his riding several times , supporting the Reform candidate there . 
unfortunately the Reform candidate did not make it this time around , but the next time is going to be another story . 
i find interesting some of the statements the member for Markham made . 
i also find very interesting the comments of the member for Thornhill on the first question . 
the member for Markham indicates that sacrifices have been made to eliminate the deficit . 
he is referring to the government side . 
i sat in this House for four years listening to the rhetoric of the other side of the House , the government side , and really when it comes down to it I never noticed too many sacrifices being made at all . 
in fact , the sacrifices made were by those that the load of debt or spending was dumped on through the different provinces , transfer payments and the like . 
the member for Markham made reference to that . 
in other words , the government has failed to transfer money to the provinces and again the provinces have to pick up the slack . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the time for questions and comments has expired . 
i wonder if the hon. member could put his question very briefly , and we will allow the hon. member to reply . 
Mr. Art Hanger : 
Mr. Speaker , I am wondering if he would like to reflect on what his party views as sacrifice . 
i know the leader of his party does not really accept the general premise that their membership may want at an assembly . 
it is open for debate and discussion . 
what does the member for Markham really consider to be a sacrifice ? 
Mr. Jim Jones : 
Mr. Speaker , what I was alluding to here is that the public has made a lot of sacrifices as we have balanced the budget , or we are close to balancing the budget . 
there has been a benefit of $ 17 billion in taxes from free trade . 
many people have had to cut costs . 
corporations have had to cut costs . 
if I said the government has made sacrifices , I am really saying that the public has made sacrifices within the last four to five years to help the government balance its budget . 
i am not so sure that the government has made the same type of sacrifices that private enterprises made . 
there are two things that we can do . 
we can try to grow revenue , and that is what this government is relying on , growing revenue . 
the other side of the coin is that we have to continue to reduce costs and find better ways of doing the job . 
i am not so sure that the government has done that . 
i am saying that the public has made the sacrifices , that the public will continue to make the sacrifices and it is the government that has to make the sacrifices on its spending habits . 
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St. 
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment and all other members who have been appointed to similar positions . 
i also congratulate the Speaker on his re - election as Speaker of the House of Commons for the 36 th Parliament . 
i would also like to congratulate all members of the House of Commons who have been elected for the first time and those who have been re - elected and are back for the second or consecutive times to this Chamber . 
having served in a provincial legislature for a number of years , I can say that coming to the House of Commons in this 36 th Parliament is certainly a very special feeling . 
i thank the people of Burin - St. 
George ' s for electing me and shouldering me with the enormous responsibility of representing them here . 
it is the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne so I will try to make my remarks pertinent to the throne speech itself . 
over the last few days I have listened intently to the various speakers and to the questions and comments that have been put in the House of Commons . 
i refer to the comment in the throne speech on the child tax benefit increase that the government is proposing to bring into effect on July 1 , 1998 . It is good to see that there will be an increase in the child tax benefit allowance . 
however , I take exception to what I have found out during that past couple of days . 
the federal government has entered into agreements with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and other provincial governments that families that are receiving social assistance will not see any of the child tax benefit increase at all . 
their incomes will not be increased by one cent . 
a clawback agreement has been entered into by the federal government and certain provincial governments that will keep the poor in essence poorer in this country . 
i have stood in provincial legislatures and now in this federal Parliament where I have heard people talk about child poverty , the need to address this very important issue and the impact of hunger on education and learning levels . 
yet I now find out that this very federal government and provincial governments have entered into agreements which in essence will see hungry children remain hungry . 
i take exception to that . 
i am sure all hon. members on a daily basis receive representation from families that have aging parents or grandparents , that have a legitimate need for home care . 
there are aging people who want to be looked after in their homes . 
with the cutbacks to health care budgets from the federal government to the provinces , more and more aging people are receiving inadequate home care . 
they are just not getting enough hours of home care . 
in today ' s society where most families have both spouses out working , it is more and more difficult for families to contribute to the home care of their loved ones . 
i was glad to see a reference to that in the throne speech and I look forward very much to seeing the specifics of the anticipated support mechanism for improved home care . 
i look forward to that . 
i am encouraged that at least there is a reference in the throne speech to the issue of home care . 
the throne speech states that government will continue to address the serious problem of international foreign overfishing . 
i come from Atlantic Canada . 
Atlantic Canadians sent this government a very strong message on June 2 , that the Liberal federal policies are not working for Atlantic Canadians . 
they wanted to show the prime minister and the government how poorly they are working on behalf of Atlantic Canadians . 
i am really not sure that the prime minister received the message . 
if he did , he is ignoring the message . 
we need quick action in Atlantic Canada . 
we need job creation initiatives , we need lower taxes , we need to get people back to work . 
the people of Atlantic Canada are suffering from a crisis which for the most part was imposed by mismanagement by successive federal governments . 
successive federal governments have mismanaged our most important resource in Atlantic Canada , our fishery . 
this government said it would continue to address the problem of foreign overfishing . 
let me say that as we sit here today there are still foreigners who are flagrantly overfishing on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks . 
the government in the last couple of weeks has entered into agreements with those who have violated our fishing treaties and contracts to give those violators more fishing inside of the 200 - mile limit . 
it says it will continue to deal with foreign overfishing when those very people are again abusing the situation and the government obviously is rewarding them for taking our fish inside of 200 . 
another fishery situation in the country which is very volatile surrounds the Pacific salmon treaty . 
i have been monitoring the situation over the last couple of months and what really jumps out at me in this situation is that in essence the government is treating the people of British Columbia and Premier Glen Clark and his government as the villains in this situation . 
another thing worth pointing out in the debate today is that each year there is supposed to be a fishing plan agreed to by the U.S. and Canada . 
in the last four years there has not been a fish plan , the only four years when there has not been a fish plan agreed to by Canada and the United States . 
i say to the prime minister and to the minister of fisheries that they should really get involved in this B.C. situation and try to resolve it . 
while the prime minister and the minister of fisheries seem to be so caught up in remaining very friendly with the Americans , our own people are entering financial crisis . 
many of them will go out of business if something is not done very soon . 
therefore I ask the minister of fisheries , the prime minister and the parliamentary secretary to the minister of fisheries to please move quickly on this very volatile situation which needs their immediate attention . 
it is a pleasure and an honour to be here in the House of Commons . 
there are some very serious problems that need to be addressed . 
i am pleased to take part in the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne and I look forward to spending another few years representing the people of Burin - St. 
George ' s . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member for Burin - St. 
George ' s , a Newfoundland riding . 
we know very well the important role that Newfoundland played in the aborted Meech Lake accord , which mentioned that Quebec was a distinct society . 
given that the Speech from the Throne mentions the unique character alluded to in the Calgary declaration , I would like the hon. member from Newfoundland - and I am sure he knows what happened , he knows the role played by Clyde Wells in the failure of Meech Lake - to tell us whether , in his opinion and the opinion of his party , the expression unique character of Quebec society as used in the meaningless Calgary declaration has the same meaning as the expression distinct society had in the Meech Lake accord . 
this is a simple question to which I would appreciate a simple and clear answer from the Conservative member . 
Mr. Bill Matthews : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question . 
i remember Meech Lake very well . 
i remember Clyde Wells very well , sometimes with pride and sometimes with not so much pride . 
we took opposing positions in the Meech Lake debate . 
the hon. member asks a question about unique character and distinct society . 
i have listened to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs a number of times through the media . 
my belief is if distinct society is the same as unique character , then why are we changing the wording ? 
that is the question I ask myself . 
if both are the same , then why are we changing the wording ? 
that is my own personal thoughts on it . 
i thank the hon. member for his question and that is my answer . 
as I reflected and watched the hon. minister on the news a number of times that was my first question . 
why are we changing it to unique character from distinct society if both mean the same thing ? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Guelph - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the hon. member for Burin - St. 
Georges this . 
i know that in the Conservative platform on which he ran in the last election two promises were made on agriculture that disturbed me a lot . 
the first was that they promised to destroy the marketing boards for the farmers . 
the second promise was to do away with the department of agriculture . 
i wonder if the hon. member would talk a bit more about those Conservative promises . 
Mr. Bill Matthews : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for her question . 
if she is disturbed with a couple of the promises that we made in our election platform , can she imagine how disturbed we are with most that they made in theirs ? 
if she can only take exception with a couple of ours , I can assure her we can take exception with dozens of hers . 
i know her question is a serious one on agriculture . 
she has the same concern with agriculture as I have about fish . 
i can only go on record and say in this Chamber what I have said publicly , that I personally did not support a proposal in the policy platform for a department of sustainable development . 
i supported it at the time and said publicly during the election campaign that my preference was for a separate truly Department of Fisheries and Oceans and I still stand by that . 
i am sure she probably feels the same about agriculture . 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , to begin with I would like to advise you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Guelph - Wellington . 
Mr. Speaker , like a number of my colleagues I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as deputy chairman of the committees of the whole House . 
i also want to congratulate our Speaker . 
as a career educator and seasoned parliamentarian he earned our trust through an election process I particularly appreciated not only as a newcomer in this House , but also as a former member of the Quebec National Assembly . 
i will always remember that the first thing I was asked to do when I arrived in Ottawa was to vote rather than having a decision imposed on me from above , which had been my experience in the past . 
this augurs well . 
i would also like to salute voters in Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies and thank them for the mandate they gave me last June when they sent me here to represent them and serve them in co - operation with my team of assistants . 
my riding of Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies is located in the northeastern part of Montreal island . 
it comprises the city of Anjou and several areas of Montreal , including the fast growing district of Rivi è re - des - Prairies . 
it is a riding where the business community is very vibrant , where businesses are increasing in number , creating more jobs , upgrading their facilities and exporting more and more . 
my riding is home to dozens of volunteer organizations serving our young people , the elderly , our families , and providing recreational activities , as well as various cultural communities , which by the way are increasingly diverse and numerous since 32 percent of my constituents are not of francophone origin . 
it is therefore an honour and a great privilege to be able to represent and to serve that population , one with a rather exceptional voter turnout of 78 percent , 47 percent of whom voted for me as the candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada . 
if I may , I would also like to thank the active Liberal party members in my riding , and the party executive , for their warm support of my nomination as a candidate . 
i wish to send particular greetings to the more than 3,000 members in good standing of our riding association who supported my progress to this seat right from the beginning . 
i have listened attentively to the throne speech , the Prime Minister ' s address and those by the four leaders of the opposition parties . 
i must say that I am very pleased to be sitting on this side of the House at this time , and I am very proud to have heard the message from the government and the Prime Minister , for a number of reasons . 
first of all , the Prime Minister has clearly explained the direction he plans to set for our team now and during the next mandate . 
in setting a path toward a more humane and more just society , he is adhering to the most profound and the most permanent Liberal values . 
this I find fitting , because it corresponds to the expectations of the people of Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , whom I represent . 
in recent years , tough decisions have had to be made , ones that have been both hard to make and hard to accept in some ways . 
i am thinking of our unemployed , our seniors , our disadvantaged families . 
i am thinking of the volunteer organizations which have had to do more , often with less . 
while maintaining its commitment to improve public finances , the government can now say it can once again respond to Canadians ' priorities without exceeding our means . 
it has indicated that it is now again able to invest not only in economic growth , which it will continue to do , but increasingly in the development of Canadian society and of its human resources - men , women , and young people - the primary capital of Canadian society . 
investing in our children , investing in health , building safer communities , offering young Canadians greater opportunities , investing in knowledge and creativity , these are some of our government ' s priorities . 
i think these commitments , once translated into laws , budgets and programs and put into effect , will take Canadian societies to new horizons of development and growth and will enable Canada to remain at the forefront of the international community . 
the throne speech also warrants praise because it basically reflects the commitments made by the Liberal Party during the last election campaign in red book II , Securing Our Future Together . 
from time to time I hear the criticism that this speech contains nothing new , nothing dramatic , that it is a rehash . 
had the throne speech contained anything other than the red book commitments , the same detractors would be accusing the government of losing sight of and turning its back on the commitments it made during the election campaign . 
what counts most for this country ' s future , for its unity and prosperity , for its men , women , young people and families , for its businesses ? 
a government committed to fulfilling its promises or a government that is easily distracted and borrows buzzwords from the opposition parties ? 
over the summer , like many of my hon. colleagues , I consulted people in my riding , business people , representatives of voluntary organizations , and union organizers from the private sector . 
they told me they wanted the government : first , to continue to support job creation and economic growth ; second , to reinvest in social programs ; and third , to settle the issue of national unity by taking into account Quebec ' s distinct and unique reality , but in co - operation with the rest of the country . 
in conclusion , I must say that I became involved in federal politics under the banner of the Liberal Party of Canada because I believe that this country can not only survive but prosper provided that the central , regional and provincial powers find a way to join forces instead of squabbling or even trying to split this country up , as the PQ government in Quebec and its prophets of doom and division , the Bloc Quebecois members , are currently doing . 
i got involved in federal politics because I believe that the federal government has a unique responsibility to bring together and mobilize every part of this country , that is to say every generation , every region and every citizen of this country , to respond to the question the Bloc Quebecois is obsessively asking with ambitious plans , mainly by ensuring that each and every one of us can achieve our full potential within the Canadian democracy while making an important contribution to the international community . 
during the course of my years of professional activity in teaching , the union movement , the environment , in consulting and in international co - operation , I learned that as Canadians we have many more similarities than differences , whether we are teachers , or engineers or unemployed , young and old . 
i learned that among Canadians there is an important desire to work together in a shared political framework . 
i learned that by working together as Canadians from Quebec and elsewhere in this country we can ensure a better future for ourselves and our children and make a most significant contribution to the well - being of the international community . 
i would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all my friends in the teaching profession across the country , and their representatives , and to the union organizers . 
i would like to pay tribute to the sustainable development promoters and supporters of the country , to the people concerned with international co - operation , and to the business people who I rubbed shoulders with in my career lives . 
i do not only wish to pay tribute to them , I also want to thank them for showing me that we have everything to gain by getting to know one another and by working together , with respect to our differences certainly , but also with the profound conviction that our membership in the Canadian family is a guarantee of security , fairness and prosperity for everyone in this country . 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
i would like to begin by congratulating my hon. colleague on his speech . 
in it , he spoke about the Bloc Quebecois ' s obsession with national unity . 
does he mean by this that it is not by asking our fellow citizens on a daily basis whether we are unique , whether we are distinct , that we will succeed in improving national unity ? 
or does he mean , as they have always said , that the issue will be sorted out within Quebec , following formal resolutions from the rest of Canada ? 
i look forward with great pleasure to my colleague ' s reply to this question . 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for Chicoutimi for raising this question . 
my remarks were in reference to the Bloc Quebecois ' unwavering question as to whether the members on this side of the House recognize the people of Quebec . 
it is the only question they have asked since the beginning - 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur : 
you still haven ' t replied . 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau : - the most obsessive . 
i replied in advance , with reference to the people that make up Canada , of course , that this included the people to which we belong in Quebec , and as French Canadians as well . 
these people are crawling backwards across the Plains of Abraham . 
they are trying to climb back up the cliffs at the Plains of Abraham in their search for their identity , when the place to seek our identity is in what lies around us , in our own experiences , in the people we encounter and in what we do with our lives , not just in wondering what our origins are and who did what . 
i intend to move in a forward direction and that is why I joined the Liberal team here on this side of the House . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i would ask hon. members to keep their questions and responses short . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it could take me quite some time to respond to this , but I shall try to be brief . 
since this morning , we have been hearing all sorts of things . 
we heard about such things as the homeland of culture , having a unique character and being a distinct society . 
the hon. member referred to distinct realities in the case of Quebec , etc. 
we had Meech , we had Charlottetown , now we have Calgary and tomorrow we may have Canada ' s Wonderland . 
not a treaty between typical , unique or distinct societies , or whatever else . 
later , Jean Lesage spoke of two founding peoples . 
will the member opposite , who is boasting because he is a government member , tell us here whether or not his government recognizes that Quebecers are a people ? 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not the type of person who engages in semantics . 
people want to know what we will do for them in the future . 
i wonder if , conversely , our friends from the Bloc Quebecois recognize that there is French Canadian people and a Canadian people . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask our colleague a question . 
he says he is proud of being with the Liberals , because the Liberals have made promises in the red book . 
i just hope he is talking about the promises contained in the second red book and not in the first red book , because those promises were not kept , and a minister was forced to resign and to seek re - election and another member was forced to join us here in the back . 
they made promises that they could not keep . 
as a member , did you and do you still agree with the employment insurance reform that imposed cuts on the workers of this country ? 
you talked about that in the past as a union organizer . 
did you and do you still agree with these cuts that our people were subjected to in the regions ? 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau : 
Mr. Speaker , first I would like to congratulate my colleague on his election , and we all know in what circumstances he was elected . 
it is with a very definite purpose in mind that I begin my answer with these words . 
i think his voice here will echo the concerns of Canadian workers , and there are other people who can play a similar role within the government party . 
we must all be sensitive to the problems workers are experiencing and this will be one of the mandates that I will be fulfilling in this House . 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the Speech from the Throne which opened Canada ' s 36 th Parliament . 
i begin by thanking the people of Guelph - Wellington for the trust and confidence they gave me and the Liberal Party on June 2 . 
the June 2 general election marked the first back to back victories for a Liberal Party candidate in 45 years in my riding . 
i am honoured to have the opportunity to serve the people of Guelph - Wellington for a second term , a term that will end in the next century . 
before I begin to speak about the present and the future I want to quote a newly elected member of Parliament , speaking in the House for the first time on May 23 , 1963 . 
i quote from the members own reply to the Speech from the Throne when he said " I am very glad to be a member of a party which has a leader of the calibre of the prime minister '' . 
those words were spoken almost 35 years ago by our current prime minister . 
i am proud to echo those words , and as they were used to describe Lester Pearson they apply quite equally to the prime minister . 
some parties in the House like to refer to the Speech from the Throne and the government ' s agenda as a return to the past . 
let us compare their record to ours . 
was it not the same parties that said we could never balance the budget ? 
we will and our country ' s finances are currently in the best position in decades . 
did these parties not predict when the Liberals were elected in 1993 that there would be more of the same ? 
instead we have witnessed in four short years record low interest rates and low inflation , the restoration of public confidence in our finances , and the beginning of hope for the unemployed . 
i will compare our record of hope , opportunity for growth and confidence against their dire predictions any day , for we have delivered . 
we can always point to the positive results of records in the 35 th Parliament . 
exports have increased to records never before imagined . 
social programs have been maintained and Canada has been judged by the United Nations , time and time again , to be the best country in the world . 
still there is something happening in my community which goes far beyond enthusiastic forecasts and strong growth . 
i have witnessed a transformation of the people of Guelph - Wellington in the years between 1993 and 1997 . 
the people of my riding are optimistic again . 
let me quote from the September 16 , 1997 edition of the Toronto Star and an article written about the technology triangle which includes Guelph - Wellington . 
it says : 
what ' s so often overlooked is that communities and regions have enormous human resources capable of providing the energy , commitment and leadership skills needed to create a new attitude and direction . 
the article continues by saying that Guelph - Wellington : 
provides one example of how people at the local level in business , government , education , social agencies and unions helped this region make a transition from old industrial Ontario to a new knowledge based one . 
sadly these communities are often overlooked for their leadership and commitment but not , however , by the Liberal government . 
in knocking on doors throughout the general election of 1997 I experienced that transformation of optimism . 
that optimism is witnessed every day by Guelph - Wellington citizens like Luiz Danninger , president of Trodat Canada Inc. , producers of self - inking office stamps . 
Luiz employs more than 30 people and works hard to succeed . 
this summer he became a Canadian citizen and represents the spirit of co - operation and partnership underlined in the Speech from the Throne . 
another example is former Guelph Liberal member of Parliament , Jim Schroder . 
Jim has given up some of his retirement time to raise funds for the new River Run Centre , an arts and entertainment complex which will officially open this week . 
Jim represents our support for the arts , which was announced in the Speech from the Throne . 
Dr. Larry Peterson of the University of Guelph was recently awarded the Helsinki medal for his work and represents the support for knowledge promoted by our government . 
there are more examples . 
Paul MacPherson is president and general manager of Valcom , a growing and successful company in Guelph - Wellington . 
Paul and his employees know firsthand the importance of the Technology Partnerships Canada and represent the support for technology that has been committed by our government . 
recently Constable Wayne Hummell of the Guelph police force was awarded a Canadian banks law enforcement award for his efforts in combating crime against banks . 
constable Hummell and members of the police forces that help protect Guelph - Wellington can only serve better because of our commitment to building safer communities . 
finally , the work of Mindy Ternan , the campaign director for the United Way community services in Guelph and Wellington county , can be helped through our commitment in investing in children and young people and the equal commitment in quality care and good health . 
the people of Guelph - Wellington have rejected the doom and gloom spouted by the nay sayers . 
on June 2 , 1997 they said yes to hope , growth and opportunity . 
they understand that Liberals throughout the history of Canada have never looked back , except to remind the opposition time and time again of the realities of Liberal success . 
we have always appreciated and comprehended the present while looking forward to the future . 
we have always worked with Canadians to find solutions to our problems . 
the government will face many challenges in the 36 th Parliament . 
we must still eliminate the deficit spending and we must still tackle an enormous debt . 
we must continue the transformation of our social programs in response to new and difficult circumstances . 
while investing in our future we must still ask for sacrifices to secure a quality of life for our seniors , our families , our young people , and each and every Canadian . 
i look forward to those challenges . 
in conclusion , I again quote that newly elected member of Parliament speaking in 1963 and saying : " The people of Canada will find in the Liberal program the solution to their problems '' . 
i believe that is true today , a solution that can only be found through optimism , co - operation , partnerships , hope in our future and belief in ourselves , a solution that will keep Canada the best country in the world . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question for the hon. member for Guelph - Wellington has to do with the throne speech and what is lacking in it , which is that there is absolutely no reference whatsoever to veterans or the merchant navy veterans . 
the hon. member ' s government took $ 182 million away from the veterans programs in the last three and a half years . 
the merchant navy veterans have never been treated equally . 
they came to me and asked for help . 
there are only 2,100 of them left out of the 12,000 . 
what is the hon. member ' s government going to do to correct the error it has made and help those veterans become eligible for the veterans programs ? 
it should put more money back into the last post fund and all the programs it has removed . 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the question . 
i do know that as we speak the government is in discussions with the merchant marine veterans . 
we believe that we can solve the problem . 
i share the member ' s concern . 
however , I have never , ever believed that the Conservatives would put more money into a program so I have no faith in that area . 
but I do share the member ' s concerns . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , another member from the province of Premier Harris , who claims to recognize Quebec as unique in the same way the Pacific salmon is unique . 
the hon. member has heard her colleague for Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , in answer to my question as to whether he , as a member of the government , recognized Quebecers as a people , reply " Yes , of course '' . 
he even went on to add : " Everyone does '' . 
so there are two questions : 
does she recognize the people of Quebec and , if so , why did she vote against the amendment we moved in this House ? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
first and foremost they are Canadians and Quebeckers . 
they are a part of Canada . 
we all know that by being a part of the federation of Canada we get a great many benefits by being Canadian . 
Quebeckers enjoy health care , unemployment insurance , welfare and all the social safety nets . 
they enjoy the use of national defence . 
i believe we all love and want Quebec in Canada . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to be here this week and also to congratulate you on your appointment to the Speaker ' s chair . 
it is with great delight that I see you there . 
i would also like to take time to thank the voters of South Surrey - White Rock - Langley for allowing me to continue as their member of Parliament . 
i am honoured to have the opportunity to serve them for another term . 
if we are ever to resolve Canada ' s unity problem we have to make significant changes to the way Canada is governed . 
my Reform colleagues who will also be speaking today will be examining various aspects of these issues in more detail . 
most Canadians know that Canada is a wonderful country to live in . 
the international community knows that Canada is the best country to live in , but the reality of today is that the majority of federal and provincial politicians from Quebec want to leave Canada . 
yet there is very little in the throne speech on how the Liberal government intends to address the threat of separation from these Quebec politicians . 
in the throne speech the government makes a commitment to work with the provinces and territories to advance the progress made in Calgary two weeks ago toward the full recognition of diversity inherent in the federation , including the unique character of Quebec society . 
unfortunately the Liberal government chose to ignore other parts of the Calgary declaration , which recognize the equality of citizens and provinces . 
the government also chose to ignore any mention in the throne speech of the premiers ' pledge to involve the public before advancing their proclamation . 
if it is the intention of the Liberal government to pursue its national unity strategy by promoting the concept of Quebec ' s unique character while ignoring the equality of Canadians and provinces and the commitment to involve the public in the process , its strategy will not work , nor will the official opposition support such a strategy . 
our support for the Calgary declaration as a starting point on unity discussions was based on the total package , not just one item out of seven . 
in the past , discussions that centred on the unique character of Quebec have been met with suspicion in British Columbia and other parts of the country . 
the two major concerns expressed by British Columbians have been that such recognition will provide Quebec with special rights , powers or privileges that are not available to other provinces , and second , that such recognition would diminish the notion that all Canadians are equal and all provinces are equal . 
the Calgary declaration explicitly acknowledges these two concerns , but if the government continues to promote the unique character of Quebec while ignoring the equality aspect of the declaration , British Columbians are apt to become even more suspicious of the federal government ' s motive . 
British Columbians , indeed all Canadians outside of Quebec , will have the opportunity to express their feelings about the Calgary declaration over the next few months . 
after these public consultations , the premiers are then expected to introduce resolutions in their respective legislatures . 
i am sure the wording of these resolutions will reflect the sentiment of the various public consultations that have occurred in their provinces . 
but will these resolutions make any difference ? 
the Bloc Quebecois says no . 
the Parti Quebecois government also says no . 
both of these parties say that the Calgary declaration is worthless and does not come anywhere close to addressing Quebec ' s grievances . 
they claim it is irrelevant , as was the Liberal government ' s Motion No. M - 26 in the last Parliament . 
some people may remember when the government quickly passed a motion to live up to the prime minister ' s promise to recognize Quebec as a distinct society . 
the Calgary declaration does not involve constitutional change and as long as there is a separatist government in Quebec , any constitutional initiatives are futile . 
not only would we have a repeat of the constitutional discussions of the early 1980 s but in another ill - advised piece of legislation passed by the government in the last Parliament , the separatist government in Quebec now has a veto over any constitutional amendment . 
no matter how beneficial another proposed constitutional amendment may be , it is extremely unlikely that the Parti Quebecois government would ever endorse it . 
thus the Calgary declaration is not aimed so much at the Quebec government but for the Quebec people . 
pollsters and pundits have been filling the airwaves and newspapers with their take on the reaction of the people of Quebec and they will continue to do so even after all the provincial resolutions have been tabled . 
we hear today of a poll out of Quebec suggesting that the majority of Quebeckers do not believe that the Calgary declaration is sufficient to address their concerns . 
however , the first real tangible evidence of the feeling of the people of Quebec may appear in the next Quebec provincial election which is expected some time next year . 
will the Calgary declaration and the resulting provincial resolutions convince Quebeckers to turf out their separatist government ? 
on their own it would appear not , but hopefully these initiatives will be viewed as a starting point to convince Quebeckers that Canadians from all across the country are prepared to resolve the country ' s unity problem within Confederation . 
as the Prime Minister stated in the throne speech debate at page 43 of Hansard : 
the day may come - I hope it will , and it will if Quebec ever has a government willing to work for those Quebeckers who wish to remain a part of Canada and they are the majority - when there is a legal and constitutional text to consider as such . 
the words from Calgary are an attempt to express worthy Canadian values and that is how they should be welcomed . 
after the next Quebec provincial election we will be faced with one of two prospects : one , a federalist government in Quebec which will require that Canadians be prepared for another constitutional initiative or two , a separatist government which will require Canadians to be prepared for another separatist referendum . 
i will address both of these scenarios , but I will first address the more desirable scenario , one that will enable a strong and united Canada to live up to its potential in the 21 st century . 
if Quebeckers recognize that they are not the only Canadians who reject the status quo and opt instead to elect a provincial government that is committed to renewing and revitalizing the federation , then Canada will undoubtedly enter another round of constitutional negotiations . 
if Quebeckers show enough faith in Canada to elect a federalist government , that faith must be rewarded . 
however , while this constitutional debate should address Quebec ' s concerns about the federation , it cannot deal exclusively with Quebec ' s concerns . 
last week a senator from B.C. made national headlines by stating that British Columbia should renegotiate its role in Confederation and that secession should be on the table . 
in response to these comments the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs almost blew a gasket in condemning the senator . 
was the senator reflecting the mood of British Columbians ? 
i believe she was . 
i will not ask the House just to believe what I think . 
the House should check with the people of B.C. , just like the Vancouver Sun did with its readers . 
they asked British Columbians if B.C. should renegotiate its place in Confederation and if it should , they asked if secession should be on the table . 
the Vancouver Sun had 1,010 responses to these questions . 
out of 1,010 responses 800 of them said yes , British Columbia should be renegotiating its role in Confederation . 
as for the more controversial aspect of including secession in these renegotiations , 700 respondents said yes , it should be there . 
that is right . 
according to the 1,010 people who responded to the Vancouver Sun ' s question , 70 percent said yes , secession should be on the table . 
the senator was just reflecting the extreme frustration that British Columbians feel . 
if that is not a wake - up call for this minister and this government , then I do not know what is . 
the task ahead does have some bright spots . 
British Columbians desire many of the same changes in Confederation that Quebeckers do . 
one of these issues is the rebalancing of powers within Confederation . 
i have often heard members of the Bloc Quebecois talk about how federal policies prevent Quebeckers from becoming masters in their own home . 
a rebalancing of powers by defining which issues should be within the provincial government ' s jurisdiction and which should be in the federal government ' s jurisdiction would certainly go a long way to resolving many of the concerns of Quebeckers and British Columbians . 
one issue that is more of a concern to British Columbia than it is to Quebec is revamping federal institutions , especially Parliament . 
British Columbia is the most under - represented province in both this House and the other place . 
in the Senate there are 104 senators . 
using the 1996 census population figures , that works out to a Canadian average of 277,373 citizens per senator . 
when we look at the per capita representation on a provincial basis , there is only one province which is near the national average , Quebec , with 297,450 people per senator . 
at the low end we have Prince Edward Island with only 33,639 citizens per senator ; New Brunswick with 73,813 people per senator . 
at the opposite end of the scale we have Ontario , with 448,065 per senator , and Alberta with 449,471 . 
at the top of the scale is British Columbia , with 620,750 citizens per senator . 
what we have is an upper chamber which reflects the reality of over 100 years ago . 
unfortunately there has been a litany of Liberal and Tory governments , dominated by central Canada , which have been quite happy to keep things just as they were back in the 19 th century . 
we are about to enter the 21 st century . 
it is time to bring representation up to date . 
he claims that westerners had the chance for Senate reform but voted against it . 
that accord called for Quebec and Ontario to give up 18 of their senators so that each province would end up with six senators . 
did Ontario and Quebec give them up out of the goodness of their hearts ? 
absolutely not . 
under the terms of the accord those 18 senators would be resurrected as 18 new members of Parliament each for Quebec and Ontario . 
thus British Columbia ' s under - representation in this House would be even more significant . 
is it any wonder that two - thirds of British Columbians rejected the accord ? 
did they really think we were that stupid ? 
there is another piece of information for the prime minister ' s attention when he says that the Charlottetown accord would have elected senators . 
it is true that the accord allowed for the election of senators , but clause 4 of the accord , which amended section 23 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution Act of 1867 , allowed for the indirect election of senators by provincial legislatures . 
in other words , instead of being appointed by the prime minister they would be appointed by the premiers . 
as we approach the new millennium any rules that permit the appointment of any representatives are archaic and should be forever consigned to the 19 th century , not to the 21 st century . 
yet when this government passed Bill C - 110 in the last Parliament and handed out vetoes it recognized five regions . 
it finally acknowledged that British Columbia is unique from the prairie provinces . 
the Calgary declaration acknowledges the equality of all citizens and all provinces . 
to accomplish this equality we must have true representation by population in the House of Commons . 
earlier I mentioned British Columbians ' under - representation in the Senate . 
B.C. is equally unrepresented in this House . 
the range in representation goes from 33,639 in Prince Edward Island to 109,544 in B.C. Is this equality ? 
i do not think so . 
it is due to a little heralded constitutional amendment made in 1985 that guaranteed that no province would ever lose seats in redistribution . 
what that means is today we have six provinces that have this constitutional protection . 
six provinces have an average of 73,900 people per MP . 
meanwhile , three provinces are significantly under - represented in this House and they average 105,366 people per MP . 
with the 1985 amendment , this inequity is likely to be permanent unless the Constitution is changed again . 
one thing that B.C. will likely be asking for is to be treated equally , nothing more , nothing less . 
just in case members are wondering why this is important to B.C. , we happen to believe that if we had our due representation in Parliament then maybe we would not have a government that handles foreign overfishing off the Pacific coast by taking the B.C. government to court . 
maybe we would not have a government that closes the only military base on the mainland of British Columbia which just happens to have the highest risk for a major earthquake in a populated area . 
before I conclude my comments I would like to briefly mention what will happen if Quebecers opt to re - elect the Parti Quebecois , the separatists . 
i am certain that the people of British Columbia , as well as members of the official opposition , will want to make certain that Quebecers know the consequences of what a vote for separation will mean . 
first and foremost , I would like to dispel the myth that separatists like to spread that after separation there would be a friendly equal partnership between Quebec and the rest of Canada . 
i would like to inform the Quebec separatists that there is no such thing as the rest of Canada . 
the separatists have no idea what shape the remainder of Confederation will be in after a yes vote . 
if Quebec votes to separate rest assured that British Columbians will review their options . 
do not get me wrong , British Columbians love Canada and will do everything in their power to have it remain united . 
however , we expect that when Canada enters the next millennium it will be a country where all Canadians and all provinces are treated equally , fairly and with respect . 
British Columbians are asking for nothing more and will settle for nothing less . 
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened very intently to the member for South Surrey - White Rock - Langley . 
i am very disheartened by her tact today . 
i am from Ontario and I have never in my life stood up here and talked about the fact that Ontario feels gypped by Confederation . 
i have also lived in British Columbia and I can assure the member that the people of that province do not think the way she is talking today . 
i have heard her party time and time again talk about the need to transfer powers to the provinces . 
we have the social health and safety transfer which is block funding to the provinces which allows the provinces to spend the money in any way they want . 
what you tell me about the equality of people and how we are going to maintain basic national - 
the Speaker : 
colleagues , I remind all of you to please address your remarks to the Chair . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
Mr. Speaker , it is no great surprise to me that Ontario does not feel cheated by Confederation when it seems to control the country . 
unless it happens in Ontario it seems that it does not matter . 
how does the member expect to understand what British Columbians are thinking when he does not even listen to what they are saying ? 
seventy per cent of the people in B.C. who responded to a survey said that secession should be on the table . 
the Speaker : 
once again , with all respect , I remind you to address your remarks to the Chair . 
it being almost 2 p.m. , we will now proceed to Statements by Members . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
hybrid TURKEYS 
Ms. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , tomorrow I will have pleasure of attending the facilities expansion celebration of Hybrid Turkeys in Kitchener . 
i would like to take this opportunity to welcome to Canada Henk Bakker , the chief operating officer of Hybrid Turkeys ' parent company , Nutreco , from the Netherlands . 
he , together with Hybrid ' s company president Paul Jeenes , will celebrate the completion of their recent expansion . 
hybrid Turkeys is Canada ' s only primary breeder of turkeys , one of only three worldwide , exporting over $ 15 million in large white turkey breeding stock to over 40 countries . 
i would like to recognize the contribution of Hybrid Turkeys to Kitchener . 
through its expansion and building of new facilities , including a new production hatchery , new administration offices and a new diagnostics lab , its investments have created long term jobs and will have a sustained , positive economic impact on the Kitchener area . 
this is the kind of success story that comes through the co - operation and partnership of business and government to the benefit of the communities involved . 
* * * 
justice 
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week ' s throne speech had little to offer Canadians on the justice platform . 
victims continue to have to relive the memory of their violent loss through early parole applications . 
it was silent on conditional sentencing . 
violent sex offenders and even those who take life are still able to avoid jail terms . 
the throne speech was particularly silent on two issues the Minister of Justice had said concerned her , violent young offenders and victim rights . 
our citizens cry for changes and improvements to legislation but the Liberals do not appear to me listing . 
the Reform Party is listening and I pledge to my constituents and fellow Canadians that we will be continually pressing the government to address these and other important justice issues . 
* * * 
BRITISH COLUMBIA 
Mr. John Cannis ( Scarborough Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , hearing Conservative Senator Pat Carney of British Columbia last week making statements that frustrated provinces should not rule out separation from Canada made me very angry and very upset not only as a Canadian , not only as a parliamentarian , but as a parent who , along with my colleagues , is working diligently to make sure we make this country of ours prosperous , strong and united for us , our children and generations to come . 
pat Carney , an unelected and it would seem unaccountable appointee , made a statement about how tired she was of the bias shown by the federal government toward B.C. 
i was glad to hear the other members of the Conservative Party , including their leader , not support her views . 
why is it that every time the federal government does not agree with the provinces these types of tactics have to be used ? 
today Sir John A . Macdonald would be turning in his grave . 
long live a strong and united Canada . 
* * * 
senator PAT CARNEY 
Mr. Paul Mercier ( Terrebonne - Blainville , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week Conservative Senator Pat Carney stated that the sovereignty of British Columbia ought to be examined as a valid alternative . 
like many Canadians and Quebecers , the Conservative senator is dissatisfied with the status quo and realizes that the federal government , whether Conservative or Liberal , is totally incapable of reforming and renewing the Canadian Constitution . 
the words of the Conservative Senator are in contrast to those of her leader , who has nothing to contribute in response to the backward step represented by the Calgary declaration . 
even in the west , the political elite is starting to come face to face with reality . 
senator Carney ' s statements are part of a far broader movement . 
whether viewed from the west or from the east , Canada in the 21 st century will surely not resemble the dream the Prime Minister describes in his throne speech .

throne SPEECH 
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Algoma - Manitoulin , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week ' s throne speech has once again proven to Canadians that this government is a caring and responsible government . 
thanks to the government ' s efforts and to the sacrifices of Canadians over the last four years , a balanced budget is within sight for the first time in decades . 
a balanced budget not only provides economic stability for our nation ' s finances but peace of mind for all our citizens regarding the future of our valued social programs . 
canada ' s economy is producing impressive employment growth . 
interest rates and inflation remain low but more needs to be done to ensure that all Canadians in all parts of our country are able to fully participate in this economic renewal . 
this is particularly true for rural Canada . 
to this end , our government has committed half of future budget surpluses to the reinvestment in strengthening our society , families and communities . 
our government will continue to focus resources wisely in key areas of the economy creating a better environment for our children and ensuring that our health care and public pension systems continue to be among our country ' s greatest assets . 
our government has demonstrated its commitment to responsible economic management . 
it has also shown care and compassion for ensuring that all Canadians are able to share in the economic benefits of a growing economy with healthy public finances .

Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to recognize the presence in the gallery of one of Canada ' s most well - known and internationally acclaimed film makers , Mr. Atom Egoyan . 
Mr. Egoyan , who is a guest of the Minister of Canadian Heritage , is here with his wife , Arsin é e Khanjian , who also appears in her husband ' s most recent and critically lauded film The Sweet Hereafter , and their son Arshile . 
Atom Egoyan was the most decorated film maker at this year ' s Cannes International Film Festival , with The Sweet Hereafter taking home three awards , including the Grand Prix , the highest international honour ever awarded to a Canadian feature film . 
i would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the producers of The Sweet Hereafter , Alliance Communications Corporation , and to thank Telefilm Canada for its financial contribution to the film . 
on behalf of all Canadians I would like to say to Mr. Egoyan that we are all extremely proud of what he has accomplished for Canadian films and for Canadians .

parliament 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , 
democracy was under strain 
in parliament 35 
for some it was a struggle 
to keep those principles alive . 
committees without consensus 
made it tough to co - operate 
with just one point of view heard 
the results were great . 
quite seriously flawed 
it really seemed a fraud . 
this session could be different 
more difficult you see 
to ram bad legislation 
down the throats of you and me . 
fewer attempts at closure 
to stifle honest debate 
and well thought legislation 
wouldn ' t that be great ! 
this 36 th sitting of the House 
it really could be choice 
an opportunity once more 
to listen to the voice 
of those who chose to send us here 
who expect us to deliver 
more than MP trained seals 
stop making shady deals 
reform is pushing for improved democracy 
and we ' re snapping at your heels !

culture 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , contrary to the statement made in this House by the Minister of Canadian Heritage , the film proposed by Pierre Falardeau depicting the death of Chevalier de Lorimier will not be funded by Telefilm Canada for political reasons . 
in the light of this politicization of culture , a group of men and women has started a campaign to find popular funding to produce this film , which will revive an important moment of Quebecers ' history . 
the repression of 1837 - 38 led to the sacking of a half dozen villages , the hanging of a dozen patriots , the exile of thousands of people and the incarceration of 400 in a city of 60,000 . 
the Bloc Quebecois would today like to congratulate the men and women of Comit é du 15 f é vrier 1839 on their initiative and calls on all members of this House , regardless of their political allegiance , to make a contribution as a show of their commitment to freedom of expression .

police AND PEACE OFFICERS 
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( London West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday on Parliament Hill the 20 th annual police and peace officers memorial service was held . 
it was an occasion for all of us to remember that part of the reason why we live in this secure and safe society is because of the dedication of professional police and peace officers who work across this country . 
unfortunately it is ceremonies such as the annual memorial service that make us realize our safety has come sometimes at the cost of those who are working , the best and the brightest that we have in these forces . 
being a peace officer is a very difficult job full of many challenges . 
in Canada we are fortunate to have police forces who carry out their daily work with honesty and integrity and dedication . 
it is a time when we should all pause to reflect on the contribution of our police and peace officers , who they are and what they make as a contribution to our Canadian society .

QUEBEC PREMIER 
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Quebecers are upset by the attitude of the separatists . 
the priority of all Quebecers is to get the economy moving once again . 
the Government of Canada is doing its share , but if the Bouchard government continues to represent the interests of the separatists only , Quebecers will never reap the benefits . 
by continuing to represent only the interests of the separatists , Lucien Bouchard is showing that he does not care about all Quebecers . 
on his arrival in France for a so called economic mission , the first thing he did when he got out of the plane was to talk to the French about separation again . 
now we have even the Conseil du Patronat fran ç ais acknowledging that the temporary removal of the threat of referendum in Quebec has permitted a settling of interest rates , with all due respect to Mr. Bouchard . 
it is high time that the separatists of Lucien Bouchard started working for the welfare of all Quebecers .

justice 
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the people of Okanagan - Coquihalla to bring to the attention of the House another failure of the Canadian justice system . 
on September 7 my hometown of Summerland was shocked by the news of a double homicide . 
Cecilia and Tammy Grono were shot to death in front of Tammy ' s 2 and 4 - year old children . 
the prime suspect is the ex - husband of Tammy who was on day parole . 
Kevin Machell failed to report to his halfway house in Calgary . 
Tammy Grono had written Corrections Canada and requested that she be notified of any changes in his status . 
the Gronos would be alive today if the solicitor general ' s department had acted . 
Kevin Machell is still at large . 
Canadians are demanding a parole system that is limited , earned and tightly monitored . 
the Liberal government has failed to ensure that Canadians are secure in their homes and on the streets of their communities .

university OF TORONTO 
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to bring to the attention of the House the recent donation of $ 9.7 million to the University of Toronto chemistry department by Mrs. Edna Davenport and the estate of her late husband John Davenport . 
the surprise announcement of this generous gift came at a dinner last night honouring six Nobel laureates from around the world , including our own John Polanyi of the University of Toronto . 
the chair of the chemistry department at the University of Toronto , Dr. Martin Moscovits , has said that the gift will be used to build state of the art molecular science laboratories at the university ' s chemistry building and will ensure that the University of Toronto and Canada remain world leaders in research in chemistry . 
Philanthropy of this type is rare and greatly appreciated . 
i hope one day it will lead to future Nobel laureates from the University of Toronto . 
i know that I am joined by the University of Toronto community , members of this House and indeed all Canadians in thanking the Davenports for this spectacular act of generosity .

canada POST 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to bring to light the current crisis concerning the negotiations between Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers . 
it is due to government interference that this situation has developed into the state it is in now . 
i refer to a memo that describes a meeting between the Minister of Public Works and Government Services and the president of the Canadian Direct Marketing Association . 
according to the memo the minister suggested that the government might use conciliation to delay negotiations , blame the unions for a strike and then introduce back to work legislation within eight days of any strike action . 
this strategy by the government and the management at Canada Post makes a mockery of the collective bargaining process . 
it suggests the conciliation process was never intended to resolve the major issues and is tantamount to denying the postal workers their legal right to strike . 
i suggest to the minister that he remove the threat of back to work legislation and allow the union and management to seriously negotiate a collective agreement .

QUEBEC PREMIER 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Lucien Bouchard has barely started his sovereignist pilgrimage to France to find symbolic support for his separatist cause and already the truth he refuses to see is hitting him right in the face . 
a document released at a press conference held by Lucien Bouchard and French business representatives states that the temporary removal of the referendum threat has resulted in lower short term interest rates in Canada . 
French business people too recognize that the political uncertainty generated by the sovereignist threat is hurting Quebec ' s and Canada ' s economy . 
what more does Lucien Bouchard need to hear to put an end to such a costly threat to our economy ? 
* * * 
search AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS 
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the need to replace our aging and unreliable search and rescue helicopters was established over four years ago . 
we hope the government ' s decision to postpone the replacement of these helicopters , at an enormous cost to Canadian taxpayers , will not have unfortunate consequences . 
if there are any further accidents , injuries or losses due to the prime minister ' s callous partisanship in delaying this purchase , Canada will hold him personally accountable . 
for the safety of the men and women who fly these helicopters , we sincerely hope we will never reach that point . 
party politics have no place in the managing of our Canadian forces . 
the Speaker : 
my colleagues , I want to thank you very much for last week . 
it seems that the question period is progressing very well thanks to you because you want it , not because I want it . 
i would encourage you in the name of the House to please continue to keep the questions right on time and the answers also . 
with this I am going to recognize the hon. Leader of the Opposition . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
CALGARY DECLARATION 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the papers are quoting opinion polls in Quebec in which Quebeckers were asked their opinion on the premiers ' declaration from Calgary . 
however most Quebeckers have no way of knowing what is in that declaration , that it is primarily a commitment to consult the public and that what it is seeking to do is to balance acknowledgement of uniqueness with acknowledgement of equality as citizens and provinces . 
all Quebeckers have heard about this agreement is some negative attacks by the Premier of Quebec . 
my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
what specific steps will he take to inform Quebeckers about the content of the Calgary declaration ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is very difficult to have the same kind of process in Quebec as in the other provinces since the Premier of Quebec is not interested in consulting the people of Quebec about the Calgary declaration . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week when the government indicated that it might consult ordinary Quebeckers with respect to the Calgary declaration , a hostile Premier Bouchard said " I dare you '' . 
meanwhile Bouchard is off consulting the Government of France and Quebeckers are kept in the dark concerning what Canadians in other parts of the country are proposing to make the federation work for the benefit of all . 
will the minister mail a copy of the Calgary declaration to every household in Quebec , or will he be intimidated by the Premier of Quebec on this vital issue of consultation ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I may have shortcomings , but being intimidated by the premier of Quebec is certainly not one of them . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if the government is not to be intimidated by the Premier of Quebec and is not prepared to say exactly how it will consult with Quebeckers on the premiers ' declaration , could the minister at least make the simple commitment to mail a copy of the Calgary declaration to every household in Quebec so Quebeckers will at least know what is being talked about in the rest of the country ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Calgary declaration has been released widely by the media in Quebec , but the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is welcome and we will study it . 
* * * 
BRITISH COLUMBIA 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government professes to be concerned about the unity of federation , yet when a B.C. senator commented on the topic last week the minister responded with disdain . 
today the Vancouver Sun reports that almost 70 percent of respondents support Senator Carney ' s comments , including her suggestion that B.C. should not rule out separation . 
could the minister explain why he and his government are so insensitive to the concerns of British Columbia ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a common practice of separatist leaders in Quebec to describe anyone who is fighting separation as someone who is fighting Quebec . 
secession , no , no and no . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , neither British Columbians nor I are calling for secession . 
what we are calling for is a little respect from the government . 
the government responds to foreign overfishing off the west coast by taking the B.C. government to court . 
would the minister agree it is because of the government ' s mishandling of west coast issues that so many British Columbians do not feel at home in Confederation ? 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member started by talking about the Pacific salmon treaty , as she did last week with the same preface to the question . 
we wish to have a treaty with the Americans which guarantees proper management of west coast fish stocks , whether they be in Canadian rivers or in others . 
the issue with the province of British Columbia is defence , the Nanoose base which we believe to be extraneous . 
i would remind the hon. member when she talks about the closure of bases that bases have been closed in Quebec , in the maritimes , in Alberta and in Ontario . 
* * * 
CALGARY DECLARATION 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
i would like to know if the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs agrees with the leader of the official opposition , who - must I remind the hon. members - is considered by the Prime Minister to be a key player in the debate on Canadian unity . 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
it is a pity , Mr. Speaker , that the Bloc leader cannot put the question to the leader of the official opposition . 
what I understand of the official opposition leader ' s position is that he wishes all principles , including the recognition of the unique character of the society in Quebec , to be discussed . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
it is a pity , Mr. Speaker , that the minister cannot answer the questions put to him . 
my question was quite clear . 
we want to know if he agrees with the leader of the official opposition , who is against any recognition of distinct society . 
the leader of the official opposition was not the only one to comment on the Calgary declaration over the weekend , as Quebec Liberals stated that , as far as they were concerned , the Calgary declaration was not enough , that it needed to be fleshed out . 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Calgary declaration was very well received in Quebec . 
i can see how this would concern the Bloc leader . 
Quebecers regard it as a step in the right direction , but when asked if it is enough , of course they say it is not . 
the public wants improvements and one way to improve this federation would be through the principles set out in the Calgary declaration , including the recognition of the unique character of Quebec ' s society . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one wonders whether the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs lives in Quebec . 
we read the papers and we see - 
an hon. member : 
that ' s a cheap remark . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier : 
it is not . 
one wonders whether he still lives in Quebec , because he misinterprets what is going on there . 
he badly misinterprets it . 
last weekend the federalists in the Liberal Party of Quebec - they are federalists in Quebec ' s Liberal Party , not sovereigntists - found the Calgary declaration wanting , given Quebec ' s traditional expectations . 
my question for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is this : 
does he realize that even the most modest demands from Quebec ' s federalists place the bar so high that the premiers of the other provinces cannot make it over ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
no , Mr. Speaker , the member has it all wrong . 
Mr. Johnson explained that it was a step in the right direction , that it was a good start and that he also had other demands . 
i know of no other province that does not have other demands . 
they all have demands for improvement . 
the Government of Canada also has demands , and we are working together , in partnership . 
this country offers the best standard of living in the world . 
and we will continue to do so , regardless of the member . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs realize that the only Quebec federalists who still hold any hope for the Calgary declaration are those who think that " unique character " means the same thing as " distinct society " and that it will be in the Constitution , exactly the opposite of the message delivered by the Leader of the Opposition on the weekend to the rest of Canada ? 
does the minister realize this ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
we are going to go on improving Canada in various ways , particularly by strengthening the recognition of Quebec in the Canadian Constitution . 
* * * 
environment 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment . 
in 1992 at the Rio earth summit Canada agreed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 . 
in 1994 the deputy prime minister and former environment minister committed to further cut CO 2 emissions by 20 per cent . 
yet in today Canada it is almost 10 percent above those levels . 
when will the government finally show leadership and live up to its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ? 
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Government of Canada is very concerned about meeting realistic , legally binding targets at the meeting we are to have in Kyoto , Japan , in December . 
we made commitments at Rio in 1992 to try to achieve reductions by the year 2000 . 
we have admitted that we are not able to achieve those targets , but we are trying to work with all our partners in Canada and abroad to make sure that we achieve realistic targets for the future . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are getting very concerned that all we hear from the government is concern but nothing in the way of solid , detailed plans . 
even the prime minister has said that he supports legally binding targets , but where is the plan ? 
my question is for the Minister of the Environment . 
could she assure us that she will take to Kyoto in two months time a specific detailed plan that lives up to Canada ' s promise to reduce emissions by 20 per cent from 1988 levels by the year 2005 ? 
will the environment minister commit to this today ? 
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
no , Mr. Speaker , I will not be committing to that today in the House . 
the government has a commitment to work with our partners in Canada and with the international community to meet realistic targets . 
* * * 
government EXPENDITURES 
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the health minister . 
Canadians know the government has wasted an obscene amount of their money to delay the purchase of helicopters that Canada needs . 
will the Minister of Health agree that the colossal waste of money cancelling the helicopter contract would have been better spent on health and education transfers to provinces ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a health question in terms of making sure that the people who operate our search and rescue helicopters have the best possible equipment because they do save lives . 
for someone from the Conservative ranks to be raising an issue like this one after they were prepared , when they were in government , to spend an exorbitant amount of taxpayers ' money to buy helicopters that were far in excess of our needs , is a little bit of gall . 
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is now for the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
the Liberal government has spent close to a million dollars cancelling a helicopter purchase , which it now admits it will have to go through with anyway . 
it argues that spending $ 90 million to create 3,000 jobs will reduce the excessively high youth unemployment rate . 
when will this Liberal government stop wasting the taxpayers ' money for petty politics and start assuming its responsibility to deal with the crisis of youth unemployment ? 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his question , and I can tell him in reply that , of necessity , governing implies assuming responsibilities in a great many areas . 
of course we have responsibility for defence , since we are a large country with defence responsibilities . 
we also have a foreign policy , and social responsibilities . 
as for the youth situation , I believe that the youth employment strategy announced by 12 of my colleagues and myself this past February is beginning to show some very promising results . 
i am extremely pleased to see the Prime Minister of Canada and the premiers have specifically addressed the situation of our young people - 
the Speaker : 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. minister . 
the member for Athabasca has the floor . 
* * * 
VOISEY ' S BAY 
Mr. David Chatters ( Athabasca , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Voisey ' s Bay nickel project has already produced $ 4.3 billion worth of investment and promises thousands of highly paid permanent jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of resource royalty revenue for Newfoundland and Labrador . 
i spent four years in this place listening to this government make commitments to maintain existing regulations once a mining company has invested substantially in a mining project . 
my question for the natural resources minister is why is the government threatening the viability of this project by constantly changing the regulation . 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the objective of the Government of Canada , as with all the other players in the potential Voisey ' s Bay development , is the development of an environmentally sound project whose benefits are shared in a responsible manner by all the key stakeholders . 
the Government of Canada has been working with all the other partners to facilitate the necessary agreements among all the players to allow the project to go forward in a proper manner . 
the hon. gentleman will know that there are a number of players . 
the Government of Canada is only one of several that are participating . 
Mr. David Chatters ( Athabasca , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , all that warm fuzzy talk has simply served to delay this project two and a half years and place it in jeopardy . 
all of the industry knows that the precedent set in a Newfoundland court last week will put in jeopardy resource mining development all over Canada . 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , mining in Canada is important not only to the government but to all Canadians . 
it is a major engine of economic growth , one we intend to promote . 
over the course of the last several years we have moved on at least 60 different cases of eliminating overlap and duplication in mining regulations . 
i am working with my provincial colleagues to continue that momentum . 
* * * 
pay EQUITY 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board . 
certain information has it that the President of the Treasury Board plans to introduce a bill whose objective would be to side step Canadian human rights legislation on pay equity in order to impose his position in this matter . 
would the minister confirm that he is preparing , through legislation , to impose his settlement in the matter of pay equity without awaiting the decision of the human rights tribunal , which may go against him ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government clearly supports pay equity , since it passed legislation on the matter in 1978 . 
what remains to be decided is the amount of the adjustments to be made to ensure pay equity exists in practice . 
the government has already paid out $ 1 billion for pay equity and it has proposed nearly $ 1.3 billion in its current negotiations , which it intends to continue . 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , you will understand that I did not really get a response to my question , and so I will put it again a little more clearly . 
does the President of the Treasury Board intend to comply with the upcoming decision of the human rights tribunal in the matter of pay equity ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , clearly it would be better to reach a negotiated settlement with the unions . 
* * * 
taxation 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of National Revenue . 
last summer the Tax Court of Canada struck down a cruel effort by the minister ' s department to impose back payroll taxes on Mrs. Janice Collingridge , a severely disabled , low income , non - verbal quadriplegic . 
the minister ' s lawyers said that by contracting care givers to help her live at home she was running a business in her home and was therefore assessed nearly $ 5,000 in back payroll and CPP taxes and penalties . 
is it the policy of this minister and government that severely disabled Canadians who contract home care services are in fact running businesses and will be dragged through the courts and encounter personal financial hardship to satisfy this government ' s insatiable desire for tax dollars ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for his question . 
i would also like to inform the member that I could not comment on any specific cases . 
i have had representations from the member which I will look at . 
i also want to ensure the member that we have a fairness code in Revenue Canada and we are committed to the fairness code . 
we abide by that code as well . 
i can assure the member that this minister will take those representations and look at the matter . 
i can also assure him there is an Income Tax Act and we are supposed to follow that . 
i as minister will ensure we do that for all Canadians so that we have fairness - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Calgary Southeast 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , frankly I am shocked at that answer . 
this is a simple question . 
can this minister not stand up in this House and say that it is not the policy of this government to pursue and chase down severely disabled Canadians in the courts to try to squeeze money out of them ? 
are they or are they not running businesses by employing personal care givers at home ? 
i do not see anything in the Income Tax Act about that . 
is this minister in charge of his department and its policy or is this minister ' s department in charge of him ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are proud of the work we have done in the disabled community . 
the solicitor general was involved in a one year task force which made recommendations to the government . 
if we look at the last budget we have made substantial commitments and this finance minister in his last financial budget made a commitment of over $ 300 million for the disabled community . 
we are proud of what we have done for the disabled community and we will continue it . 
it surprised a few on that side of the House . 
the members of the Reform did not support those items - 
* * * 
MIRABEL AIRPORT 
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
how does the Minister of Transport explain the fact that mayor of Montreal himself said he met with the Prime Minister to discuss the Dorval issue , and a settlement was reached with Ottawa ' s help ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said last Friday , the decision to move flights from Mirabel to Dorval was made by A é roports de Montr éal. 
that was not a political decision . 
the A é roports de Montr é al group has that power and exercised it . 
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , will the minister tell us how the Prime Minister can agree to discuss the Dorval airport issue with the mayor of Montreal but refuse to discuss the Mirabel airport issue with the premier of Quebec , as he told us on Friday ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister has received from the premier of Quebec a letter to which he will reply . 
* * * 
health 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Health Canada officials lied to obtain the personal protected files of Dr. Mich è le Brill - Edwards . 
this scientist is a thorn in the side of the department , with personal allegations that there are problems where profits take precedence over safety . 
the minister promised us a full report here in the House . 
what has he found about his officials ? 
the Speaker : 
was the word " lied " used in the hon. member ' s question ? 
i did not hear it . 
would the hon. member be kind enough to rephrase the question ? 
Mr. Grant Hill : 
Mr. Speaker , Health Canada officials covered up the truth . 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member can use any words he chooses . 
the reality is he does not have the faintest idea of what he is talking about . 
another example of all kinds of noise and fury . 
last Friday afternoon department officials explained why they had asked for the file in question . 
as long as I am Minister of Health we will focus on the issues affecting the health system . 
we will not be involved in any smear campaigns . 
we are going to work to improve medicare in this country and make sure - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Macleod . 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have their feeble excuse for accessing this file too . 
the fact of the matter is permission must be sought of the individual . 
it was not . 
the minister has a choice opportunity here . 
he could choose to support out of control bureaucrats on a witch hunt or he could choose to support the scientist who has allegations of truth . 
which will it be ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member has taken the facts wrongly and then he has misinterpreted them . 
i have already explained that we are going to appoint an arm ' s length science advisory board to get independent assessment . 
we are going to have a public consultation and we are freezing further cuts . 
that is the best way to respond . 
* * * 
federal DETENTION CENTRES 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Solicitor General . 
events in recent months have shown that working conditions for employees in federal detention centres in Quebec are extremely dangerous . 
will the Solicitor General respond to the request that I made of him at the beginning of September to establish an external inquiry into the volatile situation that prevails in federal detention centres in Quebec ? 
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the opportunity to reassure the employees of Correctional Services Canada that we are very mindful of the danger their job carries with it . 
we say this specifically after the recognition of peace officers which took place yesterday . 
yes , I would like to confirm to the member that we are very mindful of the dangerous situation which all correctional officers face , which is a part of what they do every day .

policing OF AIRPORTS 
Mr. Robert Bertrand ( Pontiac - Gatineau - Labelle , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question concerns the safety of Montreal ' s airports . 
the maintenance of RCMP services at Dorval and Mirabel continues to be the subject of a wide range of speculation . 
my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
can the minister tell the House , so as to clarify matters , who will be responsible for policing Montreal ' s airports ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the safety of air transportation continues to be the Government of Canada ' s priority . 
as the member well knows , there are two airports in Montreal , and international flights have just been transferred . 
there are also major renovations under way at Dorval . 
for these reasons , the Government of Canada has decided to leave the RCMP forces in place during this period of change . 
the RCMP will stay at Dorval and Mirabel .

supreme COURT OF CANADA 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , earlier this month one of the justices of the Supreme Court of Canada announced that he was retiring . 
he publicly called on the Liberal government to select his replacement through an open review process . 
these comments are unheard of and ground breaking . 
the justices themselves are asking for reform . 
my question is for the Minister of Justice . 
will the Liberal government hold a public review of any new justice appointed to the supreme court ? 
or will it continue on making its appointments in secret and behind closed doors ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
i would like to point out , and I hope all members agree , that over the past 130 - some years the appointment process by which supreme court justices have been appointed has led to some of the most distinguished and meritorious people serving on the Supreme Court of Canada . 
i have indicated that there is some merit in considering how we could broaden the consultation process in relation to prospective appointments to the court . 
i will take that under advisement . 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this new justice of the supreme court will be determining whether Quebec has the right to unilaterally secede . 
this is perhaps one of the most important issues in our country ' s history . 
will the justice minister allow elected members of Parliament to ratify this new supreme court justice or will she simply consult her backroom dealmakers and continue to leave the Canadian people out of the process ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :

mining 
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment . 
the Cheviot mine proposal will place a large development in a pristine wilderness area across the divide from previous mine sites and adjacent to the Jasper National Park , a world heritage site . 
is the minister satisfied that all options , such as project relocation , have been explored to ensure that the ecosystem impacts are minimized and , at the same time , protecting important jobs in the area ? 
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the proposal to put in place the Cheviot mine project in Alberta has been reviewed by a joint panel under the Environmental Assessment Agency which brought together federal representatives with provincial representatives . 
evidence was put forward by three federal government departments and many others from across the country who are concerned about this project . 
we have received a report from the panel and are reviewing its recommendations .

law ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday I attended a memorial service honouring those law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty . 
one way of ensuring protection for peace officers , indeed all Canadians , is to ensure individuals convicted of first degree murder do not receive early release . 
this summer the Olson hearing as well as the 300 murderers with the right to apply for early release highlight the need for change in this area . 
will the Minister of Justice stop worrying about the protection of the rights of criminals , do the right thing and repeal section 745 , this offensive and potentially dangerous piece of legislation . 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
he may not be aware , because he was not a member of the House in the last session of Parliament , but my predecessor as minister of justice made significant reforms to section 745 . 
i think we will see that those reforms strike the right balance between due concern for victims , due concern for the safety of society and due concern for a criminal justice system that reflects a balance of values . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians should know that the modifications made in January 1997 , of which the Liberals are so proud , do not prevent dangerous criminals like Paul Bernardo from applying for early release . 
will the minister stop attempting to bury this issue , revisit her refusal to strike down section 745 , to prevent Bernardo and other killers from putting the families through this public , tortuous and senseless process of faint hope hearings ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would remind the hon. member that one of the amendments my predecessor made to section 745 was a device called judicial screening . 
certainly Mr. Bernardo and any others who find themselves in his situation will now have to go through a process of judicial screening . 
it would seem to me that judicial screening will ensure the safety of the public in relation to killers like Mr. Bernardo .

mining 
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Cardinal River Divide has been virtually untouched since the last ice age , and the proposed mine 23 kilometres long by 3 kilometres wide will have a profound impact on its ecosystem . 
the government ' s own departments have drawn concern to this . 
will the Minister of the Environment assure Canadians that Parks Canada , Environment Canada and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans environmental impact assessment concerns are addressed and a proper management plan initiated ? 
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the recommendations of the panel are being very carefully reviewed by the federal government in preparing its response to the proponent . 
we are very conscious of the environmental concerns and environmental impacts in this area . 
we are doing everything to make sure those concerns are addressed .

industry 
Ms. Beth Phinney ( Hamilton Mountain , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the Speech from the Throne the government indicated that it would help small and medium size enterprises develop and commercialize new techniques . 
can the Minister of Industry indicate how the government intends to go about this ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the first step is to deepen and increase the resources available for the government ' s program of industrial research assistance of the National Research Council , winner of the prestigious Ernest C . Manning Award and a program which is at the forefront of helping small business develop and commercialize technology . 
in addition we have refocused and broadened the mandate of the Business Development Bank of Canada . 
we have increased the funding available to small business under the Small Business Loans Act . 
we continue to see small businesses prospering as never before in the wake of interest rates at the lowest level in 30 years -

immigration 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration . 
the minister has revealed that a year ago she set up an organized crime unit in immigration which , as she has said , has thousands of names on file , has a well staffed operation and has good international contacts . 
can the minister tell the House how Lai Tong Sang , the Macao Triad leader who received landed status in Canada , slipped through the stranglehold the minister has on organized crime ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is very clear that anyone who misrepresents his identity or his reasons for coming to Canada can be prosecuted by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration .

policing OF AIRPORTS 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
since April 16 , 1996 , the federal government has been withdrawing from policing airports . 
the RCMP has been gradually pulling out everywhere in Canada , except in Quebec . 
according to Richard Cacchione , president of ADM , the federal government is refusing to withdraw from the Montreal airports for political reasons . 
will the minister confirm in this House that his government is refusing to withdraw from policing Montreal airports over a flag , which has nothing to do with efficiency or security ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I believe I answered this question in full earlier . 
because of the renovations , because of the change and because of the unique situation of having two international airports at Montreal , the government feels that the RCMP should stay there during this period of change .

helicopters 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is a simple one for the minister of defence . 
there is a lot of chatter about helicopters , Mr. Minister , concerning what is been taking so long to conform to the contract . 
i would like an update on when the government is going to make an announcement about helicopters for the Canadian people . 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the question . 
no decision has been made yet . 
a very detailed analysis has been made that teams of officials have been pouring over to make sure that we get the best value for the Canadian taxpayer . 
we want to make sure that we get the kind of helicopter that will best meet the operational needs of the people who go out and save lives . 
over 400 rescues a year are conducted and over 200 people are rescued in those endeavours . 
therefore , we want to make sure that we get the best helicopters for the best value . 
we hope to have that decision -

ports CANADA POLICE 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
ports Canada police officers are specialists in their field . 
they are trained in national and international crimes such as drug trafficking , illegal immigration and terrorist activities , as well as gun running . 
security guards and local police forces are not . 
why is the Minister of Transport subjecting our communities to the possibility of increased crime by disbanding the Ports Canada police ? 
does the minister realize that a lack of national standards for policing our ports will make them much more inviting to criminal elements ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member , for whom I have great respect , is being very irresponsible to suggest that there will be an increase in crime . 
this is about the devolution of authority to local organizations , councils and communities . 
it is a policy that the former Conservative government talked about quite a bit but never did anything about it . 
we put this regime in place . 
i can assure the member that the quality of policing will not suffer and crime will not increase . 
it is going quite well across the country , including the Atlantic and the port of Vancouver .

justice 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the justice minister . 
when she was appointed and gave her first speech to the bar association this summer it was tough talk all the way . 
she was going to tighten up victims ' rights , tighten up the Young Offenders Act even more and tighten up parole reform . 
there was not one word about any of that stuff in the throne speech . 
what happened to all that tough talk ? 
who in cabinet vetoed her for the throne speech ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I respond to that question . 
in relation to crime prevention , we are in fact in the process of developing a new crime prevention strategy with partners as it relates to victims . 
we have begun our consultations -

goods AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , harmonizing the GST and the QST resulted in considerable costs estimated at over $ 2 billion and paid for by the Quebec government alone . 
my question is for the Minister of Finance . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member knows full well that we offered to compensate the provinces that lost money . 
the fact is that some provinces , including Ontario , Quebec , British Columbia and Alberta , would not have lost money if federal and provincial sales taxes had been harmonized . 
in fact , Quebec did not lose money . 
let me just quote some figures . 
in the first year following harmonization , Quebec experienced a 2.7 percent increase , but no losses ; in the second year , a 20.4 percent increase in sales tax revenues and no losses ; in the third year , an increase of 17 - 
the Speaker : 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. minister , but this will bring to a close our question period .

people ' S TAX FORM ACT 
last week the prime minister defended his government ' s handouts : $ 42,000 for a Latin song book , $ 100,000 for a military golf course , and $ 19,000 for golf balls . 
when I gave my constituents the opportunity to fill out the people ' s tax form they told me in no uncertain terms that they did not want their tax dollars spent on official bilingualism , funding for special interests groups , gun registration , foreign aid , multiculturalism , the National Film Board , subsidies to businesses and the CBC . 
today I am reintroducing the people ' s tax form act which will give all taxpayers the opportunity to tell the government what they think by voluntarily filling out a form which would be included with each tax kit distributed by Revenue Canada .

criminal CODE 
section 227 of the Criminal Code now states that no person can be convicted of a homicide if the death occurs more than a year and day from the time of the offence . 
this private member ' s bill would allow murder charges to be laid if the assault resulted in death , no matter how long the victim was able to hang on to life . 
i was pleased to hear that the Minister of Justice also planned some legislation to scrap this section . 
i urge her to facilitate this process by supporting my private member ' s bill . 
in fact it addresses the very issue .

access TO INFORMATION ACT 
Mr. Speaker , the bill will make all crown corporations subject to the Access to Information Act . 
as it stands now crown corporations such as Canada Post , the CBC and the Canadian Wheat Board are exempt from access to information even though they are subsidized by our tax dollars . 
one must ask why the CBC and the wheat board should be exempt from access to information . 
during the last Parliament the auditor general published a scathing report on the operation of crown corporations . 
the bill will open crown corporations to the public and make them accountable . 
it is my hope the House will recognize the right of all Canadians and support the bill . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

access TO INFORMATION ACT 
Mr. Speaker , today I am introducing this Reform bill dealing with the rights of Canadians to know what their government is pulling on them . 
it is a bill that says Canadians have the right to know where their hard earned but easily spent tax dollars are going . 
the bill would force the government to disclose the results of all public opinion polls to the public . 
under today ' s system the government does not have to do this . 
the government only releases the results of public opinion polls when it wants to . 
this is a blatant disregard for the rights of taxpayers . 
i believe those who pay for the survey must be allowed to see the results of the survey . 
if the Prime Minister wants to keep the results of his public opinion polls to himself , he should pay for the public opinion poll himself .

divorce ACT 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 218 , an act to amend the Divorce Act ( marriage counselling required before divorce granted ) . 
Mr. Speaker , this year the Vanier Institute advised Canadians that the divorce rate in Canada had now reached 50 percent and that 75 percent of common law relationships break down within the first five years . 
sixty per cent of these relationships involve children . 
when they break down , 85 percent of the families are mother led . 
the bill requires mandatory counselling prior to legal sanction or granting of a divorce , not to try to reconcile a broken marriage but rather to serve two purposes . 
one is to ensure an appropriate parenting plan is in place for children of a broken family and to address the serious issue of post - divorce acrimony .

Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I have the honour to present the following petition . 
the petitioners draw the attention of the House to the fact that Canadian consumers are deeply affected by the price hikes in gasoline . 
though gasoline is a Canadian natural resource , Canadians have little control over this important resource . 
therefore they request that Parliament encourage the establishment of a gas price review commission to keep gasoline prices and other oil products in check .

Mrs. Sharon Hayes ( Port Moody - Coquitlam , Ref. ) :

the petitions contain 100 signatures from Medicine Hat , over 300 from Lethbridge , 132 from Winnipeg - Selkirk , 62 from Regina , and hundreds more from the St. Catharines area of Ontario . 
the petitioners call upon the government and draw attention to section 43 of the Criminal Code that says every school teacher , parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child who is under their care , if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances . 
they request Parliament to affirm the duty of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their own conscience and beliefs , and to retain section 43 in Canada ' s Criminal Code as it is currently worded .

speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
the Deputy Speaker ( Mr. Milliken ) : 
when the House broke for question period the hon. member for South Surrey - White Rock - Langley had eight minutes remaining in questions and comments following her speech . 
questions and comments . 
there being none , we will resume debate . 
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to take the opportunity first of all in participating in this debate to express my sincere gratitude to the prime minister for the confidence he has placed in me by appointing me as the Solicitor General of Canada . 
i am particularly honoured and proud to have been given this task . 
i also want to express my regrets to those members particularly from New Brunswick who served in the 35 th parliament and were not re - elected . 
their leadership will be sadly missed . 
last week we listened with interest and with optimism to the Speech from the Throne opening this the 36 th session of Parliament . 
this occasion was particularly significant to me as a newly appointed minister . 
this is a parliament with a unique and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national issues to secure the social and economic future of Canadians as we approach the next millennium . 
as solicitor general I am responsible for providing national leadership on issues relating to federal corrections , policing and national security . 
as such I would like today to address this session of the throne speech dealing with building safer communities . 
i want to provide an overview of the direction my ministry will be pursuing to help protect the safety and security of Canadians . 
Canadians identify their feeling of personal safety and security as the one overriding element that contributes to their definition of being Canadian . 
the notion of living in safe communities is a hallmark of the Canadian identity . 
we know that crime creates fear not just for our personal safety but also for the safety of our families and our communities . 
it undermines the very quality of life in our neighbourhoods . 
canada is a comparatively safe society with a crime rate that has dropped steadily over the last four years . 
yet there are many indications that Canadians do not feel safe and that is a reality to which governments must respond . 
Canadians are entitled to know and feel that their communities are as safe , as peaceful and as secure as we can make them . 
since the government ' s first election to office in 1993 , we have made public safety a priority for action . 
we have made solid gains . 
carrying through on our red book promises over the past four years resulted in an intensive focus on criminal law issues to improve public safety . 
in particular , Canadians told us loud and clear that they wanted the government to get tough on violent high risk offenders . 
here are just some of the measures that we took to improve public safety in that way . 
we strengthened the dangerous offender provisions in the Criminal Code , created a new long term offender designation and passed measures to make it easier to detain until the end of sentence sex offenders who victimize children . 
we devised a national flagging system to help crown attorneys identify high risk offenders . 
we established a national volunteer screening system to help organizations screen out child sexual abusers who apply to work with children . 
the overarching theme of our safe communities agenda in the second red book is that building safer communities requires a multidimensional balanced approach . 
this government recognizes the importance of dealing firmly with those offenders who threaten public safety . 
some offenders must be imprisoned and in some cases for lengthy periods of time . 
this is not debatable in order to protect the public . 
our best long term protection results from their return to a law - abiding lifestyle in the community . 
this approach does not mean being soft on crime nor letting criminals go free . 
it means making these offenders responsible and accountable for their crimes through other means . 
the Speech from the Throne speaks to the issue of alternatives . 
the federal and provincial governments are committed to developing alternatives to incarceration for non - violent offenders who can safely and effectively be managed in the community . 
let me say also a few words about public attitudes on criminal justice issues as they relate to this subject . 
the results of the Angus Reid survey suggest how we may further reform Canada ' s criminal justice system but they also speak to the need to involve citizens in the communities in the development of safe and effective solutions . 
this is nowhere more important than in our work to address the needs of aboriginal offenders who continue to be overrepresented in our correctional system . 
while dealing more appropriately with high and low risk offenders will remain a priority , it is imperative that we also work to prevent crime in the first instance . 
as stated in the Speech from the Throne , the government will increase funding for community based crime prevention initiatives to $ 30 million a year . 
in our safe communities agenda we focus on crime prevention at the community level which is essentially a process of community building with local involvement over a wide range of issues . 
there is a wide consensus that successful crime prevention must take a comprehensive approach to tackling the root problems that lead to crime , and that these efforts must start at the earliest stages of a child ' s life . 
our efforts must bring together the expertise of those responsible for housing , social services , public health , recreation , schools and policing . 
our efforts should include the contributions of the ordinary citizens who live and work in the very communities we seek to serve and protect . 
in 1994 the National Crime Prevention Council was established as part of the national strategy on community safety and crime prevention . 
together with the council and the Department of Justice , my department is targeting prevention programs where they are needed and will have the greatest impact . 
these include aboriginal communities . 
in the coming months we plan to work more closely with aboriginal communities to develop crime prevention initiatives . 
this speaks directly to the red book commitment concerning the reduction of crime in aboriginal communities by assisting these communities in the development of community driven activities . 
another focus of our crime prevention activities involves young people . 
issues related to youth crime including the victimization of young people , the most vulnerable members of our society , will continue as a priority in my ministry . 
we look forward to helping to renew and develop new partnerships between communities , the police , the voluntary sector and all levels of government . 
corrections staff and the National Parole Board need police and court information to make good decisions on handling offenders . 
i spoke earlier of the need for the government to provide leadership in policing . 
to this end just a few days ago I introduced legislation to create Canada ' s first national DNA data bank . 
the data bank to be established and maintained by the RCMP will be a powerful investigative tool to help protect Canadians from violent and repeat criminals . 
with this legislation Canada will become one of only a handful of countries to have a DNA data bank . 
another area where police have said they need more and sharper tools is in the fight against organized crime . 
organized criminal activities are clearly a matter of growing concern for the police , the general public and the government . 
the recent bikers war in Quebec underscores that organized crime is not something intangible , something that happens in dark alleys hidden from view , but can and does have a direct impact on our neighbourhoods . 
the international trafficking in illicit drugs with associated money laundering continues to be the highest threat of all . 
recognizing that organized crime knows no jurisdictional boundaries , our efforts to fight it are and will continue to be domestic , continental and international in scope . 
nationally there is a strong and growing commitment among police and law enforcement agencies in all jurisdictions to work with my ministry and the Department of Justice to build stronger partnerships to combat organized crime . 
this fall I will be making in the House of Commons the first annual statement on organized crime to report on the implementation of the anti - gang legislation , Bill C - 95 , and our efforts to improve co - ordinated enforcement . 
also in this regard I will be meeting tomorrow with Janet Reno , the American attorney general , to review progress and identify the next steps in our co - operative Canada - U.S. efforts to fight cross - border crime . 
citizen participation in determining solutions is no longer an option . 
as far as we are concerned it is an obligation . 
we in government must not forget our obligation to keep Canadians informed of developments in the criminal justice system . 
we need to share information about issues of importance to Canadians in order that we can have fruitful and informed discussions on those very issues . 
i would also like to speak briefly as a minister from the province of New Brunswick . 
the throne speech was clear in stating that in order to secure a strong Canada for the 21 st century , governments will need to work more closely with others in partnership . 
we will have to welcome new ideas that are citizen based , pursue more aggressively the strategic alliances available to us and consider collaboration an essential ingredient for our national and regional success . 
it is about achieving together what we could not possibly do alone . 
governments at all levels are becoming more mindful of this new imperative in the conduct of their business . 
as a result citizens can expect better decisions and more informed policy making from their leaders . 
this is important too in deciding what the state itself can do best and what the state should concede to the community as a better place for certain things to get done . 
for example Canada ' s old age security and medicare benefits are regulated and funded by the national government and rightly so . 
the enviable success of these programs would not have been achieved without the resources and overarching presence of the federal authority . 
i earlier indicated my commitment to involve communities in the issue of crime prevention . 
fixing crime in the different communities in our country will come only with the direct and meaningful involvement of those placed in and knowledgeable about the particular communities in which they reside . 
the role of the national government in such cases should not be to prescribe solutions ; rather government ' s role is to encourage and help facilitate a process of problem solving at the community level from the ground up . 
this approach to governing is not indicated only for crime prevention . 
communities it turns out are the best places to address a range of problems from poverty and unemployment to human resources development . 
thanks to the foresight of the four Atlantic premiers an Atlantic vision conference is being organized next month in Moncton . 
the conference is planned as an important step in a process of sharing and discovery aimed at economic recovery in Atlantic Canada . 
other federal ministers will also attend . 
the deliberations will be conducted in a true spirit of partnership , federally , provincially and interprovincially . 
this is as it should be and the better will be the chances of success for the conference and for our region . 
we know that economic growth solutions in Atlantic Canada will be found in Atlantic Canada if each of the four provinces seeks solutions on their own for a stronger economy . 
the Atlantic vision conference will feature sharing , collaboration and consensus building . 
it aims for the crystallization of federal , provincial and industry participation in the region ' s future development . 
while we recognize there is a great deal to be done , it is the beginning of a voyage toward economic recovery . 
the Atlantic premiers deserve our commendation for their vision in undertaking this project . 
the leadership in Atlantic Canada recognizes it is a part of a larger community which is Canada . 
the challenge is to find ways for all Atlantic Canadians to both contribute to and share in our national bounty . 
the Atlantic vision conference plays quite largely in making this possible . 
this will be a collaborative exercise , one which I understand very well . 
in my own constituency I have made it a practice to hold regular , broadly based , very visible community forums . 
i held a forum on aboriginal justice issues during the third week of August in Fredericton . 
other consultations I have engaged in in the short time I have been solicitor general include meetings with IACOLE , the Canadian criminal justice system , the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police , the aboriginal police chiefs and the national reference group which we established with some 40 organizations . 
we spent a day together here in Ottawa discussing the issues of importance to that community . 
i also visited the RCMP depot in Regina to discuss policing issues with members of the RCMP . 
we approach the new millennium with great optimism , but we also recognize that difficult decisions will have to be made . 
i firmly believe that we are on track , that we are making progress and that we are well equipped to handle both the challenges and the opportunities which lie ahead . 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
i can tell the minister , man to man , that it does not . 
i have had people visit my office who have been fearful for their lives . 
they are fearful because of a murder which occurred 15 years ago . 
the murder was so bad that the presiding judge said there would be no opportunity for parole for a minimum of 25 years . 
that was a condition of the sentence . 
my constituents have now been put in the position of being fearful for their lives . 
this was a case of first degree murder . 
the judge said it was such a heinous crime that the individual would not be permitted parole for 25 years . 
these people are being put through a meat grinder . 
i would like the solicitor general to answer my constituents . 
how is it that this government can be so unfeeling and so callous toward the victims , the family members of the victims and the family members of the murderer himself ? 
why do they have to go through this ? 
second , today when a judge sentences a first degree murderer and says this crime is so heinous that this individual may not have the opportunity for parole for 25 years , what do those words mean ? 
they mean nothing . 
under existing legislation he will be able to apply for parole in 15 years , notwithstanding the sentencing recommendations of the judge . 
can the solicitor general please explain to my constituents , indeed to all Canadians , why the government insists on giving this open door policy to first degree murderers at the expense of the people who are the victims in these cases ? 
hon. Andy Scott : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to reassure the member of my own strong feelings about these issues as well . 
surely all members of the House would recognize that each of us deals with people in the circumstances that the member has referred to in our activities as members of Parliament and each of us is moved by those stories . 
i am certain the member recognizes that of all of us . 
in terms of the government ' s reaction to the circumstances that we found when we took office in 1993 , actions were taken . 
they have been repeated often and I will repeat them again . 
the reality is the likelihood of a person ' s being able to exercise what has become known as the faint hope clause in the Criminal Code has been limited by the fact that now there is a screening process where a judge would have to determine the likelihood of success . 
originally in the legislation eight out of twelve members of the jury had to make that determination . 
now it has to be unanimous . 
those are just two things . 
the bottom line is that the likelihood of that option being exercised , the likelihood of people having access to liberty , as I think the reference was by the member to an open door policy , is not really reflective of the likelihood of that happening . 
it is really more likely to be an extremely faint hope . 
that is the position of the government to this point . 
it is one that I believe does strike the balance that the Minister of Justice refers to . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the solicitor general for attaining one of the highest positions that any lawyer in this country can attain . 
my question is a furtherance of a question brought forward by the hon. member from Saint John . 
it refers to the devolution of powers of ports police to municipal police officers and potentially RCMP officers . 
this has happened most recently in Vancouver . 
there are plans to do the same in the port of Saint John as well as the port of Halifax . 
how does this sit in terms of its consistency with the government ' s position in terms of firearms . 
trying to keep illegal firearms out of this country is going to be a huge problem when we have municipal police officers trying to do the specialized job of policing ports . 
how does the policy that the government is putting forward in terms of firearms sit with its decision to devolve this specialized task presently performed by ports police ? 
hon. Andy Scott : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his intervention . 
it is our first opportunity to engage in this place , and I suspect it will be the first of many . 
that is a healthy thing among maritimers , I am sure . 
i should also correct the reference in his question to the fact that it is the highest office perhaps that a lawyer can hold . 
it is also the highest office a sociologist can hold , I think , since I am not a lawyer . 
i would like to speak specifically to the question of port police . 
i have had occasion to meet with the authority in Saint John . 
we have discussed this issue on a number of fronts , having to do with questions of security and also questions of job security and so on . 
i know members opposite are concerned about that . 
i have begun an initiative to see what might be done in that regard . 
we have to remind everyone that there remains an overarching criminal responsibility with the RCMP that is collaborative with whomever , local police authorities in our ports . 
the good work of the former mayor of Saint John to bring the municipal police force to the level it is will lend itself to a wonderful port authority and police authority in that city . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we just mentioned the devolution of powers from the RCMP to local police forces . 
in the province of Quebec , we know that , for some time now , the S û ret é du Qu é bec has been taking on a lot of responsibilities throughout the Quebec territory . 
earlier , during question period , when the transport minister was asked if the RCMP would remain in Mirabel and Dorval , he said that there would be no devolution of powers to Quebec police forces in that area . 
but that is just for the time being . 
hon. Andy Scott : 
Mr. Speaker , the presence of the RCMP at Mirabel and Dorval reflects changes that are going on with regard to those two airports that cannot be duplicated anywhere else in the country . 
as far as the timetable is concerned , it really falls within the responsibilities of the Minister of Transport in terms of his responsibility to provide the security of those airports . 
the RCMP , in this case , is simply meeting the needs as they are identified by him . 
as to how long we will be doing that , I say quite honestly that will be really up to the Ministry of Transport to make that determination . 
the RCMP is simply there meeting that need as requested . 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Scarborough East . 
this government has delivered on its key 1993 election promise to restore fiscal responsibility to the nation after the record $ 42 billion annual deficit we inherited from the predecessor Conservative government . 
as the Speech from the Throne has noted , we are now well ahead of our own optimistic 1993 projections to balance the budget by the year 2000 . 
we expect to achieve this budgetary goal no later than the fiscal year 1998 - 99 . 
we are putting the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward track and we have undertaken to devote one - half of the anticipated annual surplus to a combination of reducing taxes for Canadian citizens and amortizing the vast accumulated national debt left behind by the predecessor Conservative government . 
we will continue these policies . 
members will note from the Speech from the Throne that the government has understood , better I think than governments in other countries , that the approaching 21 st century will be a knowledge century dominated by those who have mastered the new sciences and technologies and who have comprehended the infomatics revolution . 
in our last budgets we invested heavily in education capital from the $ 167 million for the TRIUMPH advanced physics research project at the University of British Columbia , with its direct spin - off to major industrial export contracts abroad , to the foundation for innovation with $ 800 million for modernizing advanced research infrastructures in health and medicine , environment , science and engineering , and the $ 50 million a year for creating networks for centres of excellence . 
canada leads today in the aerospace industry , biopharmaceuticals , biotechnology in agriculture and fisheries and environmental information and telecommunications technologies . 
where our last budget offered $ 137 million in post - secondary education support for 1997 and substantially increased scholarship and tax credits for post - secondary students and their families , the Speech from the Throne commits to a new millennium scholarship endowment fund intended to reward academic excellence and to open access to universities and colleges for the well qualified children from low and moderate income families throughout Canada . 
in recognizing the key to national economic prosperity and access to meaningful long term employment for our young people lies in community investment in higher education and in advanced research , the government has learnt the main lesson from the ending of the cold war that dominated world community relations for half a century after World War II. 
the old political military base of world public order where effective power was determined by the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that one had in one ' s arsenal is completely out of date . 
of what value are those remaining ICBMs in their silos and an aging nuclear powered submarine navy if one ' s economic house is not in order ? 
the new base of world public order in relations between states is economic - industrial . 
the use or the threat of the use of force as a solver of international problems has increasingly yielded to peaceful modes of dispute settlement that rely heavily on friendly co - operation and reciprocity and mutual advantage . 
in the Speech from the Throne there is a renewed commitment to an activist , independent , internationalist role for Canada in the world community in the tradition of our one time Prime Minister and Nobel peace laureate Lester Pearson whose centenary we celebrate this year . 
rather than pursuing some far off larger international consensus that might have included also holdout superpowers at the price however of open - ended exemptions or delays or special geographical regional exceptions , our foreign minister has preferred to move now on behalf of a clear and unequivocal treaty text that really does have some teeth in it . 
at the formal signing ceremony in Ottawa this December , we do expect other countries beyond the 90 who have already rallied to the cause to join and to help perhaps to educate by their own positive example the numerically small but still important and also politically disparate groups of holdout states . 
we will continue our efforts on two oceans , the Atlantic and the Pacific , to ensure respect and full compliance with existing international law obligations , both multilateral and also special bilateral as to the protection of endangered fish resources and their equitable sharing under law . 
we will maintain the position that we have advanced in the international battle against the Helms - Burton law that a state in the application of its own national laws is limited as to any purported extraterritorial reach by the legal principles of international comity and the duty at the same time to respect the legal sovereignty of other states . 
we are continuing our efforts to establish an international criminal court which as a court of universal and general jurisdiction would replace limited geographical sectoral bodies like the recent ad hoc jurisdictions as the former Yugoslavia and also Rwanda . 
it might necessarily extend also to cover United Nations peacekeeping forces and other regional or state forces operating under UN legal authority or under the UN aegis generally . 
the end of the 20 th century as an era of historical transition has seen a remarkable convergence of two contradictory historical forces : the movement toward supranationalism and political and sometimes economic integration on a regional or at least transnational basis and the revival of local nationalism and ethnocultural particularism sometimes on a pathological basis that finds its outlet in internecine conflict within the one state . 
our renewed commitment in Canada to a strong internationalist foreign policy indicates our own Canadian , more optimistic view of the coming century and of the ability to achieve a genuinely one world outlook in a plural world community through the United Nations and related international institutions of the world community . 
Mr. John McKay ( Scarborough East , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am indeed honoured to rise in the House today , the House that John George Diefenbaker , Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Tommy Douglas have spoken in . 
it is for me a great honour as the son of a market gardener to speak in this House in this country . 
i represent the riding of Scarborough East which is bounded on the east by the largest urban wilderness park in Canada , the Rouge River Park , and on the south by the Scarborough bluffs which rise from the shores of Lake Ontario . 
since that time Toronto has grown out over top of the riding . 
had you said to my father or anyone else at the time that buses would be running up and down in front of his front door , he would have questioned your sanity . 
it is a riding of about 100,000 people , 40 per cent of whom describe their mother tongue as something other than an official language . 
as a consequence in our constituency office we serve our people in at least eight languages . 
the purpose of my speech is to talk about the role of a parliamentarian in this parliament which takes us into the millennium . 
it is a wonderful opportunity on the part of any parliamentarian to be able to participate in the process . 
during the time leading up to the writing of the Speech from the Throne , the prime minister invited members of our caucus to make submissions to him , both written and oral , concerning the contents of the Speech from the Throne . 
i was very pleased to see that the prime minister picked up on certain themes and ideas and wrote those into the Speech from the Throne . 
i would like to thank the prime minister for his willingness to listen to us as members of his caucus . 
in particular the prime minister embraced the idea that this parliament and the government will be taking this nation into the 21 st century . 
it is a monumental opportunity to foster a sense of nationhood , a sense of growth in our country and a sense of where we as Canadians can come together . 
we cannot simply expect that this will happen . 
nationhood needs to be nurtured much like children need to be nurtured . 
we as members of the 36 th Parliament will be given a privilege never afforded to any of our predecessors . 
we will take Canada into the new century and the new millennium . 
we can make it a noble time to build our nation or we can make it a destructive time . 
our citizens watch us daily and frequently they do not like what they see . 
for instance , the 26 th Parliament engaged in an intense debate about the national flag and the result of that debate graces this Chamber today . 
the 27 th Parliament introduced full health insurance to Canada . 
it was hotly debated , but its defenders , Prime Minister Pearson , Minister Martin and MP Douglas , won out . 
as a result , Canada now has one of the best health systems in the world . 
this is one of the things which define our country and a source of general pride . 
it is an affirmation of Canadian values . 
that parliament and that government also set this nation on a course to celebrate in a manner never seen before . 
canada was strong . 
it was proud and it was united . 
i remember travelling with my family from what was then a relatively provincial Toronto to the sophisticated city of Montreal to see that great city for the first time and to wonder at Man and his World exposition and to ride on the metro . 
every community in Canada celebrated its centennial in one manner or another . 
my own community raised a hospital and today it still serves our community well . 
those parliaments did great things . 
likewise this parliament can also do great things as we distance ourselves from the financial doom and gloom of the past number of years . 
i was delighted to see that a member of the 26 th Parliament , namely our prime minister , has asked a member of the 25 th Parliament , namely the deputy prime minister to initiate the organizational process required to appropriately mark our entry into the millennium . 
the government will help strike partnerships between governments , communities and people in celebration of the new millennium . 
many Canadians have original ideas and suggestions for millennium projects . 
parliamentarians of all parties will be given the opportunity to suggest activities to mark the millennium . 
he has invited members of Parliament to mark the millennium in ways that will celebrate our great nation . 
we will be able to go into our communities and ask our citizens for their input . 
it is a wonderful opportunity for the House to make submissions to the government . 
it has always been a source of disappointment to me that so few Canadians seem to appreciate or are aware of their history . 
i had a number of rather salutary experiences this summer which made me aware of that . 
i attended Saint - Jean - sur - Richelieu in the valley of the forts and I was instructed about the history of that area . 
i as an speaking Canadian was not aware of the significance of the role played by the valley of the forts in the preservation of our nation . 
there was basically guerrilla theatre between the Mohawks , the English , the Americans and the French . 
i had occasion to attend a University of Ottawa conference on the constitution . 
what struck me forcefully was a presentation by aboriginal peoples and the dates of points of significance to those people of which I was not aware . 
i was interviewing a candidate in my office , a Tamil woman . 
i asked her how and why she came to Canada . 
little did I know that her answer would touch us both in such a profound way . 
she was married in a traditional Muslim ceremony and her husband thereafter immediately left for Canada . 
she returned home and her passport was lost . 
a Tamil woman in Sri Lanka is a vulnerable person . 
when the Canadian embassy was able to intervene and secure her , she at that point felt like she was a Canadian . 
she spoke with such tremendous conviction that I was absolutely astounded . 
it brings me to the point that we do not speak to each other . 
we speak past each other , we speak around each other , but we do not speak to each other . 
i would offer to the Deputy Prime Minister the suggestion that we use means , both electronic and written to start the process of communicating to each other , that our history be recognized that there are at least four groups , aboriginal people , French people , English people and immigrant people who experience Canada in their own way . 
i ask that the Deputy Prime Minister explore ways in which that can be done . 
i would suggest that we need to assemble stories and pictures from across our land so that we will be able to communicate to each other what is historically and personally important to us so that we can make our communities even stronger . 
i would suggest that is a fitting way to mark our millennium . 
as well , Canada needs to develop its symbols of nationhood . 
i believe that one way to celebrate our millennium would be for our government to strike a millennium medal . 
that medal would be set out so that individuals in our country who have contributed to our nationhood would be recognized by the government and by Parliament . 
similarly , a millennial stamp could be issued which again would mark the build - up of our nationhood . 
those Parliaments were great and those parliamentarians were great because they encouraged their citizens to do great things . 
i am hopeful that this Parliament will similarly encourage its citizens to do great things . 
Mr. G é rard Asselin ( Charlevoix , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if I may , I will start with a reply to each of the hon. members who have shared their time . 
the first speaker referred to the deficit left behind by the Conservatives , which the government succeeded in cutting by $ 42 billion . 
the Bloc Quebecois will do everything in its power to help the government reduce its deficit . 
as we have been saying since our arrival in this House in 1993 , we do not want to reduce the government ' s deficit by cutting assistance to the least well - off and hardest - hit members of our society , including the unemployed . 
it is , of course , easy to reduce the deficit by $ 42 billion when the government does so , as I have said , by cutting benefits to the most disadvantaged and to the unemployed , and by such actions as helping itself to $ 5 billion from the employment insurance fund . 
the present government is increasingly concerned with other people ' s business , and less and less with its own . 
why ? 
to privatize its infrastructures and transfer them to provincial or regional authorities so as to avoid running a deficit . 
similarly , as part of its policy to hand over the operation of airports , the government is withdrawing from regional airport development . 
Charlevoix has struggled to maintain the Charlevoix airport , but the government refuses to refurbish this airport , which has been neglected for a number of years . 
no money has been spent on it , and today they want to transfer it to Charlevoix . 
i would like to ask a question in closing . 
do members agree that we can reduce the deficit without cutting aid to the most disadvantaged and that we should continue to eliminate waste ? 
allow me to cite only two examples , since I have only five minutes . 
i could list several hours worth of examples of government waste , but I will mention only two : promoting Canadian unity and promoting the Canadian flag , which has been recognized for over 100 years . 
Mr. John McKay : 
Mr. Speaker , I think I saw that movie last week . 
it was not very good . 
i am seeing the movie again this week . 
it has not improved . 
i expect that I will see the movie again next week . 
the hon. member needs to know that as we enter into the millennium we can do it together . 
we have been celebrating as a nation Canada ' s hockey victory over the Soviets 25 years ago . 
i would ask the member to think of a subsequent Canada - Russian series in which there was an absolutely sublime pass from the boy from Brantford to Super Mario and Super Mario deked the goalie and tucked it in upstairs . 
to me that is a metaphor for what we are as a nation , what we have been as a nation and what we can be as a nation . 
i am sincerely hopeful that Quebec will be part of this nation . 
but the year 2000 will come and we will do it together in a stronger fashion . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i must make a comment regarding the order of speakers today . 
we are going to change this order immediately because members taking part in the debate must be in the House and must rise when the Speaker announces resumption of debate . 
there were some who were not here and I would like to change the order so as to enable them to take part . 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I would like to say that I will be splitting my time with my colleague , the member for Charlesbourg . 
i want congratulate you on your appointment as an officer of the House . 
i assure you of my complete co - operation in the proceedings of this parliamentary institution , in which I intend to behave with dignity and respect . 
and might I urge you , Mr. Speaker , and your colleagues to use your experience and your authority to make this House a place in which the debate will be as vigorous as it is courteous , but also a forum that the public will hold in esteem rather than contempt . 
i would also like to take the opportunity of my maiden speech to pay tribute to the citizens of Beauharnois - Salaberry . 
this riding in the southwest corner of Quebec is graced by a majestic river , a seaway , vast lakes and fertile banks , and is proud home to the county town of Salaberry - de - Valleyfield and the cities and municipalities of Beauharnois , Huntingdon and Napierville . 
those who put their trust in me and voted for me last June I thank from the bottom of my heart . 
i give my word to those who elected me , and to all those I represent here in Parliament , that I will carry out my public duties with deep and sincere respect for my new office . 
i take this opportunity to pay my respects to my Bloc Quebecois predecessor , Laurent Lavigne , to whom I wish a well deserved rest before another referendum on Quebec ' s political future is called and he is again called upon to help build a country , a plan that he must not have lost sight of in his retreat in Saint - Stanislas - de - Kostka . 
the Speech from the Throne was disappointing . 
as I listened to it in the Senate , last Tuesday , I could not help but be disappointed by a government program with so little vision , by a speech lacking consistency , apparently designed to lead us into the next century . 
it is a collection of empty words , cautious commitments and artful dodges . 
my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois has already brought to light the weaknesses in this speech and they will continue to do so all week long . 
the proposed initiatives to promote Canada ' s economic , social and cultural development are far from innovative and unlikely to give hope and create the momentum required to get the men , women and children of this country excited about the 21 th century . 
the same goes for foreign affairs . 
considering that our country paid tribute to the memory of Lester B . Pearson by mentioning the 100 th anniversary of his birthday in the September 23 speech , the throne speech definitely did not put enough emphasis on foreign affairs . 
the current foreign affairs minister , who may succeed Lester B . Pearson as a Nobel peace prize recipient , did not manage to convince his government to give foreign affairs the importance they deserve in its agenda . 
merely listing a few measures will not provide a vision to our foreign policy . 
canada ' s initiatives to ban antipersonnel land mines , promote human rights and protect the environment are definitely good measures and will get the Bloc Quebecois ' support when , as in the previous Parliament , we feel they are compatible with Quebec ' s interests and those of the international community as a whole . 
however , the Bloc Quebecois will not hesitate to condemn the positions of a government that constantly reduces its official development assistance , or whose approach is inconsistent as regards the linkage of human rights and international trade . 
the Bloc Quebecois will also condemn the fact that Canada is slow to ratify a treaty as important as the American convention on human rights and seems too reserved regarding the inclusion of cultural exemptions in international trade agreements . 
you can also count on me , as the new Bloc Quebecois critic on foreign affairs , to expose a government that puts its foreign policy at the service of national unity . 
i will display unprecedented vigilance in this regard , and I will not miss any opportunity to respond to those who seek to jeopardize Quebec ' s autonomy at the international level , to take away the voice Quebec has gained , after an endless struggle , with various states and international institutions . 
those who would try to keep the Bloc Quebecois and its spokespersons from speaking to foreign officials in Ottawa and around the world about the political project of the Quebec government , a project shared by both the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois , will not succeed in preventing us from doing so . 
you are probably not surprised to hear me say that the throne speech has very little to inspire those who seek to put an end to the constitutional deadlock . 
i respect those who promote Canadian unity , who find some degree of comfort in the Calgary declaration and who believe in its potential to produce a reform satisfactory to Quebecers . 
like the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords , in my opinion the Calgary declaration does not contain the elements which would allow Quebecers to live with a Canadian federalism based on the equality of provinces and individuals rather than on the recognition and freedom of peoples . 
i have less respect , however , for those who support Plan B , those who are anticipating the failure of Plan A . To the ministers and members of this House who wish to insure unity through basically undemocratic pronouncements and measures and who are setting us all on a collision course , my response is that the people of Quebec is sovereign and will , when the time is ripe , reject any plan intended to restrict its freedom to be master of its own destiny . 
it is now time to acknowledge the diverging views of the peoples of Quebec and Canada on the nature and structure of the federation . 
it is time to reconcile Canada and Quebec in a new kind of partnership , a novel form of union between genuine sovereign states . 
the challenges of Quebeckers and Canadians will then be nation building , affirming the unique personalities of their two countries , and union building that is defining their common destiny within a novel body politic . 
these new challenges will replace the old divisions , allowing both Canada and Quebec to understand and appreciate each other . 
this avenue might be chosen with great reluctance , but I cite the words of a poet , Robert Frost : 
Ah when to the heart of man 
my answer , my answer to my Canadian friends , lies in a poem of Gilles Vigneault who in his Balises wrote , and so I conclude in French : 
i came to you , bearing my country , 
to sow it in your garden . 
you need not be surprised 
to see it growing in your neighbour ' s as well . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am greatly interested in my colleague ' s words . 
could the hon. member tell me if we must cut ties with the monarchy to renew Canada ? 
Mr. Daniel Turp : 
Mr. Speaker , for us Quebecers , for those who share the idea that Quebec ought to become a sovereign country , it is the people who will be sovereign . 
what I can tell you is that there are many sovereignists who wish to see Quebec remain in the Commonwealth , like other nations which have remained in the Commonwealth but do not necessarily have the Queen as their head of State . 
Quebec ' s anglophones will no doubt do a fine job of representing a sovereign Quebec within the Commonwealth ' s institutions , and we will be proud to have them representing all Quebecers there . 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , may I say to the hon. member that his brilliant reputation as student and teacher has followed him here . 
he quoted a poem by Robert Frost . 
i can quote another poem called The Road Not Taken . 
the poet indicated of the two options that life always offers . 
dare I hope that , during his parliamentary career here , the member may consider the other path , that of renewed federalism , adapted to the needs of the modern world ? 
Mr. Daniel Turp : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the parliamentary secretary and I hope my behaviour in this House may be as dignified as his own . 
as you know , Quebecers have long debated the two roads , and continue to do so . 
with the B é langer - Campeau commission , they once again agreed to debate renewed federalism . 
since 1990 , this road of renewed federalism has seemed to be a dead end . 
when we hear , as we did again this weekend , major political personages from the rest of Canada saying that the Calgary declaration is unacceptable to the rest of Canada , the implication is that , yet again , the road of renewed federalism is a dead end . 
to quote an internationalist you know very well , Emmerich De Vattel : 
" of all the rights that can belong to a nation sovereignty is doubtless the most precious '' . 
if sovereignty is precious to Canada , admit it - it is important to - so it is for Quebec . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , does the hon. member of the Bloc understand that when the country was founded the aboriginal people were here and that when the francophone people arrived the aboriginal people said to them " come on to the land and we will continue to build Canada ? " 
then the anglophone people arrived and the francophone people and the aboriginal people shook hands and said " come , we will build Canada '' . 
we are all the same . 
we are all one and we form Canada . 
i say to you , sir , that we have to realize that . 
i ask you and your party to look at that . 
we formed Canada , we built it , and I am asking you to be part of it . 
the Deputy Speaker ( Mr. Milliken ) : 
i must remind all hon. members that it is necessary to address the Chair in questions or comments . 
if the hon. member for Beauharnois - Salaberry wishes to say something , he has the floor . 
Mr. Daniel Turp : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the comments of the hon. member . 
i appreciate her concern and her will to make Quebec part of Canada . 
i believe we have exhausted constitutional remedies in Quebec . 
there will be evidence shortly that the Calgary declaration shows once again that the views of other Canadians and Quebeckers are irreconcilable . 
we will see once again that those constitutional remedies have been exhausted . 
then we will have to find a solution . 
we will have to find a solution to bind the future of people living on the same land together . 
for me and for many Quebeckers of all generations that solution is sovereignty accompanied by an offer of partnership which will be made and will continue to be made in good faith by Quebeckers like myself . 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with some emotion , and understandably so , that I address this House for the very first time . 
after ten years of militant action in favour of sovereignty , I finally have a chance to pursue my action as an elected representative . 
first of all , I would like to thank the voters in the great and beautiful riding of Charlesbourg who have chosen me to represent them . 
i was born and raised in Charlesbourg and I still live there . 
it is a privilege for me to work for the people of Charlesbourg . 
great people have spoken in this House . 
honor é Mercier went down in Quebec history as a man who asked Quebecers to set their partisan divisions aside . 
people rallied around him and his national party with the deepest conviction . 
a century later , the Bloc Quebecois has answered his call . 
while advocating a sovereign Quebec , the Bloc Quebecois is asking all Quebecers , whether they are federalists or sovereignists , Socialists , Liberals , Conservatives , ADQ or PQ supporters , to rally around and join forces to fight for the democratic rights of Quebeckers as well as for their institutions and their freedom to decide their future . 
in the early 19 th century , Louis - Joseph Papineau and the Patriot movement fought for democracy and for the rights of those who were called Canadians at the time and are now known as Quebeckers . 
Papineau fought to ensure that his people , and not some unelected individuals , decide the future . 
it is sad , a shame really , to see this struggle we thought was over resurface today . 
once again , attempts are being made to take away from Quebeckers the right to democratically decide their future and ask an unelected body , namely the Supreme Court of Canada in this instance , to decide for them . 
the point of view that the future of a nation should be decided by the people and not by elected officials was shared by Thomas Jefferson . 
Jefferson said " I can think of no safer depository for the ultimate powers of society than in the people themselves '' . 
i expect my colleagues from the Reform Party to agree with this statement as it is written in the conference room at their party ' s headquarters in Calgary . 
we the sovereignists are the defenders of democracy in Quebec . 
our goal is to ensure that Quebeckers have the right to decide their own future . 
that future is one that we are confident will be as a sovereign and proud country , dealing as an equal with its friend and neighbour , Canada . 
the Bloc is back . 
now , let ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile justice and escalation . 
let me use a practical example . 
it goes without saying that you would never accept that third party to be someone appointed and paid by your neighbour . 
moreover , should the decision be based on a contract which you have always refused to sign , you would have another reason to object . 
yet , this is precisely what this government is attempting to do . 
is this what they call justice , Mr. Speaker ? 
some even refer to us as generation x . 
still , there is absolutely nothing in the throne speech to solve this most urgent problem . 
the fight against the deficit was conducted at the expense of the poor , including young people , and they will not forget , believe me . 
as for the part of the speech entitled " Building Safer Communities '' , it hides another attempt by the federal government to encroach on areas of provincial jurisdiction . 
once again , the federal government is acting like a bull in a china shop . 
but there is more . 
the $ 30 million program to fight crime is a rehash . 
it was already public news on December 12 , 1996 , when the Globe and Mail published an article on it , on page A 16 for those who want to go back and read it . 
there is nothing new . 
this is further evidence of this government ' s total lack of imagination . 
still in that same part of the speech , I am pleased to see that the government decided to develop alternatives to imprisonment for non - violent , low - risk offenders . 
the government has finally listened to the Bloc Quebecois , which has always stressed the importance of rehabilitation . 
the Liberal government is once again proving the Bloc Quebecois right . 
let me conclude by saying it is an honour for me to be here . 
i am convinced that this 36 th Parliament will go down in history . 
indeed , I will be able to tell my children that I was part of the last group of Quebec MPs elected to the House of Commons . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member . 
is it true that the term " Canadian " is inclusive and the term " Quebecer " exclusive , and that , accordingly , Canadians are a people and Quebecers a society ? 
Mr. Richard Marceau : 
Mr. Speaker , had I rewritten the question to please myself , I would not have written it differently . 
i believe that there are some things that must be made very clear . 
the advocates of partition are the ones who are using exclusive terms and who are dangerous . 
the Quebec we dream of and want to build will be inclusive and will include the people of all nations and all the immigrants who come here in search of freedom . 
you may rely on the Bloc Quebecois to make of Quebec a people who are open - minded , tolerant and generous , and not an ethnic group , as certain people would have us believe . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I begin by congratulating the hon. member for Charlesbourg on his first speech in the House of Commons . 
i listened carefully to what he had to say . 
i also listened carefully to some of the questions his colleagues asked of colleagues of mine earlier today with respect to the understanding of the existence or non - existence of the Quebecois people . 
i acknowledge the history of that notion . 
it is fair for the member to notice the NDP , going back to its formation in 1961 , has always been ready to acknowledge that dimension of the collective existence of the Quebec people . 
we continue to argue that can be achieved , recognized and enhanced within the context of a continuing Canadian federalism . 
one of the reasons we invite members of the Bloc and other Quebeckers to do that is that the minute we begin to give up on this notion and entertain notions of separation , we come up against the hard political and philosophical reality that it is not just the Quebecois and the Quebecoises who consider themselves a people but , for instance , the aboriginal people of Quebec are also a people . 
it seems to me that we invite an infinite reductionism of self - determination the minute we get into the question of separation . 
has the member not considered the difficulty that would be posed for Canada and for Quebec in the event of a separation and in the event the Cree people of Quebec decided that they , in their own democratic self - determining way , did not want to continue to be a member of Quebec as it is now understood but rather a member of what would be left of Canada after such a separation ? 
how does he regard their democratic rights understood in that context ? 
Mr. Richard Marceau : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question . 
the Government of Quebec was the first government in Canada to recognize the existence of the aboriginal nations . 
we are proud to have done so . 
we continue to extend our friendship to the aboriginal people . 
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the member for Edmonton - Strathcona . 
i , like other members , congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair . 
on behalf of the constituents of Dauphin - Swan River I wish you a very successful term . 
i am honoured and privileged to be in the House of Commons representing the people of Dauphin - Swan River . 
i thank the people of Dauphin - Swan River for the honour . 
i pledge to them that as I take my seat on their behalf it is my responsibility to be accountable to them first and foremost . 
i would like to describe to the House the make - up of Dauphin - Swan River . 
it is as unique as the country itself . 
Dauphin - Swan River is located in west central Manitoba , the second largest settled area riding . 
it is a land of lakes , mountains and prairies . 
it is multilingual and multicultural . 
the people speak English , French , Ukrainian and Saulteaux . 
culturally it is predominantly English , Ukrainian , French and aboriginal . 
the people of Dauphin - Swan River celebrate this diversity with enthusiasm throughout the year . 
we are all proud of our ethnic heritage but we are prouder to be Canadians first . 
on a more personal note , I am a third generation Canadian . 
my Chinese grandfather came to Canada to help build the railway in the late 1800 s . 
my wife Lynda , nee Burelle , is ninth generation . 
her roots go back to 1660 , to the arrival in Quebec of É tienne Burelle and Marie Tellier from the parish of Saint - S é verin in Paris . 
they settled near Varennes , in Quebec . 
the Quebec Burelles moved west to Manitoba only in the 1900 s . 
we both still have relatives in Quebec . 
i am sure that many Canadians are in the same position . 
Quebec is as important to us as any other province in which we have family members . 
the people of Dauphin - Swan River sent me to the House to make sure their concerns are heard . 
they are not happy about the lack of jobs , the rising cost of post - secondary education , the dismantling of the health care system , the price of grain as announced recently by the Canadian Wheat Board , the cost of transporting farm products to market , the political manipulation of the grain transportation system over the last 40 years , an ineffective Young Offenders Act , and the lack of justice in that criminals appear to have more rights than law - abiding citizens . 
it has put Canadians in two camps , those living in large urban centres and those living in rural settings . 
the gun control of the government will no doubt make criminals out of millions of otherwise law - abiding Canadians across the land . 
as the deputy critic for national unity my role is to ensure that the grassroots at the municipal level are listened to and that they have a pivotal role to play in the future of Canada . 
i believe that we have failed over the last 40 years in the unity debate because we have used the wrong process . 
canada ' s vision was seen through the eyes of the Right Hon. Pierre Trudeau in the 1970 s . 
in the 1980 s the vision was through the eyes of the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney . 
in the 1990 s there has been a struggle between the old school and the new school . 
the old school wants to stick with a closed door , top down approach to solving Canada ' s challenges and problems on unity and on most other issues as well . 
the new school wants to throw open the windows and let in the fresh air , open the doors and let the people bring their ideas to the table and have a real part in making the decisions . 
sadly the old school is so far barely letting the windows and doors crack open . 
i believe that the next millennium belongs to the people of Canada , without a doubt . 
during the last forty years , the politicians have failed miserably with their top - down approach to unifying the country .
